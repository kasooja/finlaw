1,0,'§ 1020.220 Customer Identification \nPrograms for banks, savings associations, \ncredit unions, and certain non-Federally \nregulated banks. \n(a) Customer Identification Program: \nminimum requirements—(1) In general. \nA bank must implement a written \nCustomer Identification Program (CIP) \nappropriate for its size and type of \nbusiness that, at a minimum, includes \neach of the requirements of paragraphs \n(a)(1) through (5) of this section. If a \nbank is required to have an anti-money \nlaundering compliance program under \nthe regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. \n5318(h), 12 U.S.C. 1818(s), or 12 U.S.C. \n1786(q)(1), then the CIP must be a part \nof the anti-money laundering \ncompliance program. Until such time as \ncredit unions, private banks, and trust \ncompanies without a Federal functional \nregulator are subject to such a program, \ntheir CIPs must be approved by their \nboards of directors. \n(2) Identity verification procedures. \nThe CIP must include risk-based \nprocedures for verifying the identity of \neach customer to the extent reasonable \nand practicable. The procedures must \nenable the bank to form a reasonable \nbelief that it knows the true identity of \neach customer. These procedures must \nbe based on the bank’s assessment of the \nrelevant risks, including those presented \nby the various types of accounts \nmaintained by the bank, the various \nmethods of opening accounts provided \nby the bank, the various types of \nidentifying information available, and \nthe bank’s size, location, and customer \nbase. At a minimum, these procedures \nmust contain the elements described in \nthis paragraph (a)(2). \n(i) Customer information required— \n(A) In general. The CIP must contain \nprocedures for opening an account that \nspecify the identifying information that \nwill be obtained from each customer. \nExcept as permitted by paragraphs \n(a)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the \nbank must obtain, at a minimum, the \nfollowing information from the \ncustomer prior to opening an account: \n(1) Name; \n(2) Date of birth, for an individual; \n(3) Address, which shall be: \n(i) For an individual, a residential or \nbusiness street address; \n(ii) For an individual who does not \nhave a residential or business street \naddress, an Army Post Office (APO) or \nFleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or \nthe residential or business street address \nof next of kin or of another contact \nindividual; or \n(iii) For a person other than an \nindividual (such as a corporation, \npartnership, or trust), a principal place \nof business, local office, or other \nphysical location; and \n(4) Identification number, which shall \nbe: \n(i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer \nidentification number; or \n(ii) For a non-U.S. person, one or more \nof the following: A taxpayer \nidentification number; passport number \nand country of issuance; alien \nidentification card number; or number \nand country of issuance of any other \ngovernment-issued document \nevidencing nationality or residence and \nbearing a photograph or similar \nsafeguard. \nNote to Paragraph(a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When \nopening an account for a foreign business or \nenterprise that does not have an \nidentification number, the bank must request \nalternative government-issued \ndocumentation certifying the existence of the \nbusiness or enterprise. \n(B) Exception for persons applying for \na taxpayer identification number. \nInstead of obtaining a taxpayer \nidentification number from a customer \nprior to opening the account, the CIP \nmay include procedures for opening an \naccount for a customer that has applied \nfor, but has not received, a taxpayer \nidentification number. In this case, the \nCIP must include procedures to confirm \nthat the application was filed before the \ncustomer opens the account and to \nobtain the taxpayer identification \nnumber within a reasonable period of \ntime after the account is opened. \n(C) Credit card accounts. In \nconnection with a customer who opens \na credit card account, a bank may obtain \nthe identifying information about a \ncustomer required under paragraph \n(a)(2)(i)(A) by acquiring it from a third- \nparty source prior to extending credit to \nthe customer. \n(ii) Customer verification. The CIP \nmust contain procedures for verifying \nthe identity of the customer, using \ninformation obtained in accordance \nwith paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, \nwithin a reasonable time after the \naccount is opened. The procedures must \ndescribe when the bank will use \ndocuments, non-documentary methods, \nor a combination of both methods as \ndescribed in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). \n(A) Verification through documents. \nFor a bank relying on documents, the \nCIP must contain procedures that set \nforth the documents that the bank will \nuse. These documents may include: \n(1) For an individual, unexpired \ngovernment-issued identification \nevidencing nationality or residence and \nbearing a photograph or similar \nsafeguard, such as a driver’s license or \npassport; and \n(2) For a person other than an \nindividual (such as a corporation, \npartnership, or trust), documents \nshowing the existence of the entity, \nsuch as certified articles of \nincorporation, a government-issued \nbusiness license, a partnership \nagreement, or trust instrument. \n(B) Verification through non- \ndocumentary methods. For a bank \nrelying on non-documentary methods, \nthe CIP must contain procedures that \ndescribe the non-documentary methods \nthe bank will use. \n(1) These methods may include \ncontacting a customer; independently \nverifying the customer’s identity \nthrough the comparison of information \nprovided by the customer with \ninformation obtained from a consumer \nreporting agency, public database, or \nother source; checking references with \nother financial institutions; and \nobtaining a financial statement. \n(2) The bank’s non-documentary \nprocedures must address situations \nwhere an individual is unable to present \nan unexpired government-issued \nidentification document that bears a \nphotograph or similar safeguard; the \nbank is not familiar with the documents \npresented; the account is opened \nwithout obtaining documents; the \ncustomer opens the account without \nappearing in person at the bank; and \nwhere the bank is otherwise presented \nwith circumstances that increase the \nrisk that the bank will be unable to \nverify the true identity of a customer \nthrough documents. \n(C) Additional verification for certain \ncustomers. The CIP must address \nsituations where, based on the bank’s \nrisk assessment of a new account \nopened by a customer that is not an \nindividual, the bank will obtain \ninformation about individuals with \nauthority or control over such account, \nincluding signatories, in order to verify \nthe customer’s identity. This \nverification method applies only when \nthe bank cannot verify the customer’s \ntrue identity using the verification \nmethods described in paragraphs \n(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. \n(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must \ninclude procedures for responding to \ncircumstances in which the bank cannot \nform a reasonable belief that it knows \nthe true identity of a customer.

The CIP must \ninclude procedures for making and \nmaintaining a record of all information \nobtained under the procedures \nimplementing paragraph (a) of this \nsection. \n(i) Required records. At a minimum, \nthe record must include: \n(A) All identifying information about \na customer obtained under paragraph \n(a)(2)(i) of this section; \n(B) A description of any document \nthat was relied on under paragraph \n(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the \ntype of document, any identification \nnumber contained in the document, the \nplace of issuance and, if any, the date \nof issuance and expiration date; \n(C) A description of the methods and \nthe results of any measures undertaken \nto verify the identity of the customer \nunder paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of \nthis section; and \n(D) A description of the resolution of \nany substantive discrepancy discovered \nwhen verifying the identifying \ninformation obtained. \n(ii) Retention of records. The bank \nmust retain the information in \nparagraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for \nfive years after the date the account is \nclosed or, in the case of credit card \naccounts, five years after the account is \nclosed or becomes dormant. The bank \nmust retain the information in \nparagraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of \nthis section for five years after the \nrecord is made. \n(4) Comparison with government lists. \nThe CIP must include procedures for \ndetermining whether the customer \nappears on any list of known or \nsuspected terrorists or terrorist \norganizations issued by any Federal \ngovernment agency and designated as \nsuch by Treasury in consultation with \nthe Federal functional regulators. The \nprocedures must require the bank to \nmake such a determination within a \nreasonable period of time after the \naccount is opened, or earlier, if required \nby another Federal law or regulation or \nFederal directive issued in connection \nwith the applicable list. The procedures \nmust also require the bank to follow all \nFederal directives issued in connection \nwith such lists. \n(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must \ninclude procedures for providing bank \ncustomers with adequate notice that the \nbank is requesting information to verify \ntheir identities. \n(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is \nadequate if the bank generally describes \nthe identification requirements of this \nsection and provides the notice in a \nmanner reasonably designed to ensure \nthat a customer is able to view the \nnotice, or is otherwise given notice, \nbefore opening an account. For example, \ndepending upon the manner in which \nthe account is opened, a bank may post \na notice in the lobby or on its Web site, \ninclude the notice on its account \napplications, or use any other form of \nwritten or oral notice. \n(iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a \nbank may use the following sample \nlanguage to provide notice to its \ncustomers: \nImportant Information About Procedures for \nOpening a New Account \nTo help the government fight the funding \nof terrorism and money laundering activities, \nFederal law requires all financial institutions \nto obtain, verify, and record information that \nidentifies each person who opens an account. \nWhat this means for you: When you open \nan account, we will ask for your name, \naddress, date of birth, and other information \nthat will allow us to identify you. We may \nalso ask to see your driver’s license or other \nidentifying documents. \n(6) Reliance on another financial \ninstitution. The CIP may include \nprocedures specifying when a bank will \nrely on the performance by another \nfinancial institution (including an \naffiliate) of any procedures of the bank’s \nCIP, with respect to any customer of the \nbank that is opening, or has opened, an \naccount or has established a similar \nformal banking or business relationship \nwith the other financial institution to \nprovide or engage in services, dealings, \nor other financial transactions, provided \nthat: \n(i) Such reliance is reasonable under \nthe circumstances; \n(ii) The other financial institution is \nsubject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. \n5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal \nfunctional regulator; and \n(iii) The other financial institution \nenters into a contract requiring it to \ncertify annually to the bank that it has \nimplemented its anti-money laundering \nprogram, and that it will perform (or its \nagent will perform) the specified \nrequirements of the bank’s CIP.'
1,0,'(c) Other requirements unaffected. \nNothing in this section relieves a bank \nof its obligation to comply with any \nother provision in this chapter, \nincluding provisions concerning \ninformation that must be obtained, \nverified, or maintained in connection \nwith any account or transaction.'
1,0,'(c) Designation of certain exempt \npersons—(1) General. Except as \nprovided in paragraph (c)(2) of this \nsection, a bank must designate an \nexempt person by filing FinCEN Form \n110. Such designation must occur by the \nclose of the 30-calendar day period \nbeginning after the day of the first \nreportable transaction in currency with \nthat person sought to be exempted from \nreporting under the terms of this \nsection. The designation must be made \nseparately by each bank that treats the \ncustomer as an exempt person, except as \nprovided in paragraph (e)(6) of this \nsection. \n(2) Special rules. \n(i) A bank is not required to file a \nFinCEN Form 110 with respect to the \ntransfer of currency to or from: \n(A) Any of the twelve Federal Reserve \nBanks; or \n(B) Any exempt person as described \nin paragraphs (b)(1) to (3) of this section. \n(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraphs \n(b)(6)(i) and (b)(7)(i) of this section, and \nif the requirements under this section \nare otherwise satisfied, a bank may \ndesignate a non-listed business or a \npayroll customer, as described in \nparagraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section, \nas an exempt person before the \ncustomer has maintained a transaction \naccount at the bank for at least two \nmonths if the bank conducts and \ndocuments a risk-based assessment of \nthe customer and forms a reasonable \nbelief that the customer has a legitimate \nbusiness purpose for conducting \nfrequent transactions in currency.'
1,0,'(d) Annual review. At least once each \nyear, a bank must review the eligibility \nof an exempt person described in \nparagraphs (b)(4) to (7) of this section to \ndetermine whether such person remains \neligible for an exemption. As part of its \nannual review, a bank must review the \napplication of the monitoring system \nrequired to be maintained by paragraph \n(h)(2) of this section to each existing \naccount of an exempt person described \nin paragraphs (b)(6) or (b)(7) of this \nsection.'

A bank may treat a person as \na governmental department, agency, or \nentity if the name of such person \nreasonably indicates that it is described \nin paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this \nsection, or if such person is known \ngenerally in the community to be a \nState, the District of Columbia, a tribal \ngovernment, a Territory or Insular \nPossession of the United States, or a \npolitical subdivision or a wholly-owned \nagency or instrumentality of any of the \nforegoing. An entity generally exercises \ngovernmental authority on behalf of the \nUnited States, a State, or a political \nsubdivision, for purposes of paragraph \n(b)(3) of this section, only if its \nauthorities include one or more of the \npowers to tax, to exercise the authority \nof eminent domain, or to exercise police \npowers with respect to matters within \nits jurisdiction.

In \ndetermining the qualification of a \ncustomer as a non-listed business or a \npayroll customer, a bank may treat all \nexemptible accounts of the customer as \na single account. If a bank elects to treat \nall exemptible accounts of a customer as \na single account, the bank must \ncontinue to treat such accounts \nconsistently as a single account for \npurposes of determining the \nqualification of the customer as a non- \nlisted business or payroll customer. \n(6) Affiliated banks. The designation \nrequired by paragraph (c) of this section \nmay be made by a parent bank holding \ncompany or one of its bank subsidiaries \non behalf of all bank subsidiaries of the \nholding company, so long as the \ndesignation lists each bank subsidiary to \nwhich the designation shall apply. \n(7) Sole proprietorships. A sole \nproprietorship may be treated as a non- \nlisted business if it otherwise meets the \nrequirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this \nsection, as applicable. In addition, a sole \nproprietorship may be treated as a \npayroll customer if it otherwise meets \nthe requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of \nthis section, as applicable. \n(8) Ineligible businesses. A business \nengaged primarily in one or more of the \nfollowing activities may not be treated \nas a non-listed business for purposes of \nthis section: Serving as financial \ninstitutions or agents of financial \ninstitutions of any type; purchase or sale \nto customers of motor vehicles of any \nkind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment \nor mobile homes; the practice of law, \naccountancy, or medicine; auctioning of \ngoods; chartering or operation of ships, \nbuses, or aircraft; gaming of any kind \n(other than licensed parimutuel betting \nat race tracks); investment advisory \nservices or investment banking services; \nreal estate brokerage; pawn brokerage; \ntitle insurance and real estate closing; \ntrade union activities; and any other \nactivities that may be specified by \nFinCEN. A business that engages in \nmultiple business activities may be \ntreated as a non-listed business so long \nas no more than 50\% of its gross \nrevenues are derived from one or more \nof the ineligible business activities \nlisted in this paragraph (e)(8). \n(9) Exemptible accounts of a non- \nlisted business or payroll customer. The \nexemptible accounts of a non-listed \nbusiness or payroll customer include \ntransaction accounts and money market \ndeposit accounts. However, money \nmarket deposit accounts maintained \nother than in connection with a \ncommercial enterprise are not \nexemptible accounts. A transaction \naccount, for purposes of this section, is \nany account described in section \n19(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act, \n12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(C), and its \nimplementing regulations (12 CFR part \n204). A money market deposit account, \nfor purposes of this section, is any \ninterest-bearing account that is \ndescribed as a money market deposit \naccount in 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2). \n(10) Documentation. The records \nmaintained by a bank to document its \ncompliance with and administration of \nthe rules of this section shall be \nmaintained in accordance with the \nprovisions of § 1010.430.'
1,0,'(h) Obligations to file suspicious \nactivity reports and maintain system for \nmonitoring transactions in currency. (1) \nNothing in this section relieves a bank \nof the obligation, or reduces in any way \nsuch bank’s obligation, to file a report \nrequired by § 1020.320 with respect to \nany transaction, including any \ntransaction in currency that a bank \nknows, suspects, or has reason to \nsuspect is a transaction or attempted \ntransaction that is described in \n§ 1020.320(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii), or \nrelieves a bank of any reporting or \nrecordkeeping obligation imposed by \nthis chapter (except the obligation to \nreport transactions in currency pursuant \nto this chapter to the extent provided in \nthis section). Thus, for example, a sharp \nincrease from one year to the next in the \ngross total of currency transactions \nmade by an exempt customer, or \nsimilarly anomalous transactions trends \nor patterns, may trigger the obligation of \na bank under § 1020.320. \n(2) Consistent with its annual review \nobligations under paragraph (d) of this \nsection, a bank shall establish and \nmaintain a monitoring system that is \nreasonably designed to detect, for each \naccount of a non-listed business or \npayroll customer, those transactions in \ncurrency involving such account that \nwould require a bank to file a suspicious \ntransaction report. The statement in the \npreceding sentence with respect to \naccounts of non-listed business and \npayroll customers does not limit the \nobligation of banks generally to take the \nsteps necessary to satisfy the terms of \nparagraph (h)(1) of this section and \n§ 1020.320 with respect to all exempt \npersons.'
1,0,'§ 1020.320 Reports by banks of suspicious \ntransactions. \n(a) General. (1) Every bank shall file \nwith the Treasury Department, to the \nextent and in the manner required by \nthis section, a report of any suspicious \ntransaction relevant to a possible \nviolation of law or regulation. A bank \nmay also file with the Treasury \nDepartment by using the Suspicious \nActivity Report specified in paragraph \n(b)(1) of this section or otherwise, a \nreport of any suspicious transaction that \nit believes is relevant to the possible \nviolation of any law or regulation but \nwhose reporting is not required by this \nsection. \n(2) A transaction requires reporting \nunder the terms of this section if it is \nconducted or attempted by, at, or \nthrough the bank, it involves or \naggregates at least $5,000 in funds or \nother assets, and the bank knows, \nsuspects, or has reason to suspect that: \n(i) The transaction involves funds \nderived from illegal activities or is \nintended or conducted in order to hide \nor disguise funds or assets derived from \nillegal activities (including, without \nlimitation, the ownership, nature, \nsource, location, or control of such \nfunds or assets) as part of a plan to \nviolate or evade any Federal law or \nregulation or to avoid any transaction \nreporting requirement under Federal \nlaw or regulation; \n(ii) The transaction is designed to \nevade any requirements of this chapter \nor of any other regulations promulgated \nunder the Bank Secrecy Act; or \n(iii) The transaction has no business \nor apparent lawful purpose or is not the \nsort in which the particular customer \nwould normally be expected to engage, \nand the bank knows of no reasonable \nexplanation for the transaction after \nexamining the available facts, including \nthe background and possible purpose of \nthe transaction.'
1,0,'(b) Filing procedures—(1) What to file. \nA suspicious transaction shall be \nreported by completing a Suspicious \nActivity Report (‘‘SAR’’), and collecting \nand maintaining supporting \ndocumentation as required by paragraph \n(d) of this section. \n(2) Where to file. The SAR shall be \nfiled with FinCEN in a central location, \nto be determined by FinCEN, as \nindicated in the instructions to the SAR. \n(3) When to file. A bank is required to \nfile a SAR no later than 30 calendar \ndays after the date of initial detection by \nthe bank of facts that may constitute a \nbasis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was \nidentified on the date of the detection of \nthe incident requiring the filing, a bank \nmay delay filing a SAR for an additional \n30 calendar days to identify a suspect. \nIn no case shall reporting be delayed \nmore than 60 calendar days after the \ndate of initial detection of a reportable \ntransaction. In situations involving \nviolations that require immediate \nattention, such as, for example, ongoing \nmoney laundering schemes, the bank \nshall immediately notify, by telephone, \nan appropriate law enforcement \nauthority in addition to filing timely a \nSAR.'
1,0,'(d) Retention of records. A bank shall \nmaintain a copy of any SAR filed and \nthe original or business record \nequivalent of any supporting \ndocumentation for a period of five years \nfrom the date of filing the SAR. \nSupporting documentation shall be \nidentified, and maintained by the bank \nas such, and shall be deemed to have \nbeen filed with the SAR. A bank shall \nmake all supporting documentation \navailable to FinCEN and any \nappropriate law enforcement agencies or \nbank supervisory agencies upon request.'
1,0,'(f) Compliance. Compliance with this \nsection shall be audited by the \nDepartment of the Treasury, through \nFinCEN or its delegees under the terms \nof the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to \nsatisfy the requirements of this section \nmay be a violation of the reporting rules \nof the Bank Secrecy Act and of this \nchapter. Such failure may also violate \nprovisions of Title 12 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations.'

1,0,'§ 1022.380 Registration of money services \nbusinesses. \n(a) Registration requirement—(1) In \ngeneral. Except as provided in \nparagraph (a)(2) of this section, relating \nto agents, each money services business \n(whether or not licensed as a money \nservices business by any State) must \nregister with the Department of the \nTreasury and, as part of that registration, \nmaintain a list of its agents as required \nby 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. This \nsection does not apply to the U.S. Postal \nService, to agencies of the United States, \nof any State, or of any political \nsubdivision of a State, or to a person to \nthe extent that the person is an issuer, \nseller, or redeemer of stored value. \n(2) Agents. A person that is a money \nservices business solely because that \nperson serves as an agent of another \nmoney services business, see \n§ 1010.100(ff) of this Chapter, is not \nrequired to register under this section, \nbut a money services business that \nengages in activities described in \n§ 1010.100(ff) of this Chapter both on its \nown behalf and as an agent for others \nmust register under this section. For \nexample, a supermarket corporation that \nacts as an agent for an issuer of money \norders and performs no other services of \na nature and value that would cause the \ncorporation to be a money services \nbusiness, is not required to register; the \nanswer would be the same if the \nsupermarket corporation served as an \nagent both of a money order issuer and \nof a money transmitter. However, \nregistration would be required if the \nsupermarket corporation, in addition to \nacting as an agent of an issuer of money \norders, cashed checks or exchanged \ncurrencies (other than as an agent for \nanother business) in an amount greater \nthan $1,000 in currency or monetary or \nother instruments for any person on any \nday, in one or more transactions. \n(3) Agency status. The determination \nwhether a person is an agent depends \non all the facts and circumstances.'
1,0,'(b) Registration procedures—(1) In \ngeneral. (i) A money services business \nmust be registered by filing such form \nas FinCEN may specify with the \nEnterprise Computing Center in Detroit \nof the Internal Revenue Service (or such \nother location as the form may specify). \nThe information required by 31 U.S.C. \n5330(b) and any other information \nrequired by the form must be reported \nin the manner and to the extent required \nby the form. \n(ii) A branch office of a money \nservices business is not required to file \nits own registration form. A money \nservices business must, however, report \ninformation about its branch locations \nor offices as provided by the \ninstructions to the registration form. \n(iii) A money services business must \nretain a copy of any registration form \nfiled under this section and any \nregistration number that may be \nassigned to the business at a location in \nthe United States and for the period \nspecified in § 1010.430(d) of this \nChapter. \n(2) Registration period. A money \nservices business must be registered for \nthe initial registration period and each \nrenewal period. The initial registration \nperiod is the two-calendar-year period \nbeginning with the calendar year in \nwhich the money services business is \nfirst required to be registered. However, \nthe initial registration period for a \nmoney services business required to \nregister by December 31, 2001 (see \nparagraph (b)(3) of this section) is the \ntwo-calendar year period beginning \n2002. Each two-calendar-year period \nfollowing the initial registration period \nis a renewal period. \n(3) Due date. The registration form for \nthe initial registration period must be \nfiled on or before the later of December \n31, 2001, and the end of the 180-day \nperiod beginning on the day following \nthe date the business is established. The \nregistration form for a renewal period \nmust be filed on or before the last day \nof the calendar year preceding the \nrenewal period. \n(4) Events requiring re-registration. If \na money services business registered as \nsuch under the laws of any State \nexperiences a change in ownership or \ncontrol that requires the business to be \nre-registered under State law, the money \nservices business must also be re- \nregistered under this section. In \naddition, if there is a transfer of more \nthan 10 percent of the voting power or \nequity interests of a money services \nbusiness (other than a money services \nbusiness that must report such transfer \nto the Securities and Exchange \nCommission), the money services \nbusiness must be re-registered under \nthis section. Finally, if a money services \nbusiness experiences a more than 50-per \ncent increase in the number of its agents \nduring any registration period, the \nmoney services business must be re- \nregistered under this section. The \nregistration form must be filed not later \nthan 180 days after such change in \nVerDate Mar<15>2010 15:07 Oct 25, 2010 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26OCR3.SGM 26OCR3ero\nw\ne\n o\nn\n D\nSK\n5C\nLS\n3C\n1P\nRO\nD \nwi\nth\n R\nUL\nES\n3\n65857 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 206 / Tuesday, October 26, 2010 / Rules and Regulations \nownership, transfer of voting power or \nequity interests, or increase in agents. \nThe calendar year in which the change, \ntransfer, or increase occurs is treated as \nthe first year of a new two-year \nregistration period. \n(c) Persons required to file the \nregistration form. Under 31 U.S.C. \n5330(a), any person who owns or \ncontrols a money services business is \nresponsible for registering the business; \nhowever, only one registration form is \nrequired to be filed for each registration \nperiod. A person is treated as owning or \ncontrolling a money services business \nfor purposes of filing the registration \nform only to the extent provided by the \nform. If more than one person owns or \ncontrols a money services business, the \nowning or controlling persons may enter \ninto an agreement designating one of \nthem to register the business. The \nfailure of the designated person to \nregister the money services business \ndoes not, however, relieve any of the \nother persons who own or control the \nbusiness of liability for the failure to \nregister the business. See paragraph (e) \nof this section, relating to consequences \nof the failure to comply with 31 U.S.C. \n5330 or this section.'
1,0,'(d) List of agents—(1) In general. A \nmoney services business must prepare \nand maintain a list of its agents. The \ninitial list of agents must be prepared by \nJanuary 1, 2002, and must be revised \neach January 1, for the immediately \npreceding 12 month period; for money \nservices businesses established after \nDecember 31, 2001, the initial agent list \nmust be prepared by the due date of the \ninitial registration form and must be \nrevised each January 1 for the \nimmediately preceding 12-month \nperiod. The list is not filed with the \nregistration form but must be \nmaintained at the location in the United \nStates reported on the registration form \nunder paragraph (b)(1) of this section. \nUpon request, a money services \nbusiness must make its list of agents \navailable to FinCEN and any other \nappropriate law enforcement agency \n(including, without limitation, the \nexamination function of the Internal \nRevenue Service in its capacity as \ndelegee of Bank Secrecy Act \nexamination authority). Requests for \ninformation made pursuant to the \npreceding sentence shall be coordinated \nthrough FinCEN in the manner and to \nthe extent determined by FinCEN. The \noriginal list of agents and any revised \nlist must be retained for the period \nspecified in § 1010.430(d) of this \nChapter. \n(2) Information included on the list of \nagents—(i) In general.

In this case, the \nCIP must include procedures to confirm \nthat the application was filed before the \ncustomer opens the account and to \nobtain the taxpayer identification \nnumber within a reasonable period of \ntime after the account is opened. \n(ii) Customer verification. The CIP \nmust contain procedures for verifying \nthe identity of each customer, using \ninformation obtained in accordance \nwith paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, \nwithin a reasonable time before or after \nthe customer’s account is opened. The \nprocedures must describe when the \nbroker-dealer will use documents, non- \ndocumentary methods, or a combination \nof both methods, as described in this \nparagraph (a)(2)(ii). \n(A) Verification through documents. \nFor a broker-dealer relying on \ndocuments, the CIP must contain \nprocedures that set forth the documents \nthe broker-dealer will use. These \ndocuments may include: \n(1) For an individual, an unexpired \ngovernment-issued identification \nevidencing nationality or residence and \nbearing a photograph or similar \nsafeguard, such as a driver’s license or \npassport; and \n(2) For a person other than an \nindividual (such as a corporation, \npartnership or trust), documents \nshowing the existence of the entity, \nsuch as certified articles of \nincorporation, a government-issued \nbusiness license, a partnership \nagreement, or a trust instrument. \n(B) Verification through non- \ndocumentary methods. For a broker- \ndealer relying on non-documentary \nmethods, the CIP must contain \nprocedures that set forth the non- \ndocumentary methods the broker-dealer \nwill use. \n(1) These methods may include \ncontacting a customer; independently \nverifying the customer’s identity \nthrough the comparison of information \nprovided by the customer with \ninformation obtained from a consumer \nreporting agency, public database, or \nother source; checking references with \nother financial institutions; or obtaining \na financial statement. \n(2) The broker-dealer’s non- \ndocumentary procedures must address \nsituations where an individual is unable \nto present an unexpired government- \nissued identification document that \nbears a photograph or similar safeguard; \nthe broker-dealer is not familiar with the \ndocuments presented; the account is \nopened without obtaining documents; \nthe customer opens the account without \nappearing in person at the broker-dealer; \nand where the broker-dealer is \notherwise presented with circumstances \nthat increase the risk that the broker- \ndealer will be unable to verify the true \nidentity of a customer through \ndocuments. \n(C) Additional verification for certain \ncustomers. The CIP must address \nsituations where, based on the broker- \ndealer’s risk assessment of a new \naccount opened by a customer that is \nnot an individual, the broker-dealer will \nobtain information about individuals \nwith authority or control over such \naccount. This verification method \napplies only when the broker-dealer \ncannot verify the customer’s true \nidentity using the verification methods \ndescribed in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and \n(B) of this section. \n(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must \ninclude procedures for responding to \ncircumstances in which the broker- \ndealer cannot form a reasonable belief \nthat it knows the true identity of a \ncustomer.

The CIP must address \nsituations where, based on the mutual \nfund’s risk assessment of a new account \nopened by a customer that is not an \nindividual, the mutual fund will obtain \ninformation about individuals with \nauthority or control over such account, \nincluding persons authorized to effect \ntransactions in the shareholder of \nrecord’s account, in order to verify the \ncustomer’s identity. This verification \nmethod applies only when the mutual \nfund cannot verify the customer’s true \nidentity using the verification methods \ndescribed in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and \n(B) of this section. \n(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must \ninclude procedures for responding to \ncircumstances in which the mutual fund \ncannot form a reasonable belief that it \nknows the true identity of a customer. \nThese procedures should describe: \n(A) When the mutual fund should not \nopen an account; \n(B) The terms under which a customer \nmay use an account while the mutual \nfund attempts to verify the customer’s \nidentity; \n(C) When the mutual fund should file \na Suspicious Activity Report in \naccordance with applicable law and \nregulation; and \n(D) When the mutual fund should \nclose an account, after attempts to verify \na customer’s identity have failed. \n(3) Recordkeeping.

The mutual fund must retain the \ninformation in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), \n(C), and (D) of this section for five years \nafter the record is made. \n(4) Comparison with government lists. \nThe CIP must include procedures for \ndetermining whether the customer \nappears on any list of known or \nsuspected terrorists or terrorist \norganizations issued by any Federal \ngovernment agency and designated as \nsuch by the Department of the Treasury \nin consultation with the Federal \nfunctional regulators. The procedures \nmust require the mutual fund to make \nsuch a determination within a \nreasonable period of time after the \naccount is opened, or earlier, if required \nby another Federal law or regulation or \nFederal directive issued in connection \nwith the applicable list. The procedures \nmust also require the mutual fund to \nfollow all Federal directives issued in \nconnection with such lists. \n(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must \ninclude procedures for providing \nmutual fund customers with adequate \nnotice that the mutual fund is \nrequesting information to verify their \nidentities. \n(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is \nadequate if the mutual fund generally \ndescribes the identification \nrequirements of this section and \nprovides the notice in a manner \nreasonably designed to ensure that a \ncustomer is able to view the notice, or \nis otherwise given notice, before \nopening an account. For example, \ndepending on the manner in which the \naccount is opened, a mutual fund may \npost a notice on its Web site, include the \nnotice on its account applications, or \nuse any other form of written or oral \nnotice. \n(iii) Sample notice.
