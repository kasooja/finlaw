AGENCY: Financial Crimes Enforcement

Treasury. 
<Node id="1190"/>ACTION: Final rule. 
<Node id="1211"/>SUMMARY: FinCEN is issuing this final 
rule to move the Bank Secrecy Act 
(BSA) regulations to a new chapter in 
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
The new chapter contains the BSA 
regulations, which are generally 
reorganized by financial industry. 
Moving the BSA regulations to a new 
chapter and organizing the chapter by 
financial industry creates a user-friendly 
way to find regulations applicable to a 
particular financial industry. This new 
organization within the new chapter 
also allows for the renumbering of the 
BSA regulations in a manner that makes 
it easier to find regulatory requirements 
than under the numbering system 
currently used in the existing 
regulations. FinCEN also makes minor 
technical changes to the BSA 
regulations such as updating mailing 
addresses and points of contact. 
DATES: Effective Date: March 1, 2011. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Regulatory Policy and Programs 
Division, FinCEN (800) 949&#x2013;2732 and 
select option 6. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<Node id="2223"/>I. Background 
<Node id="2238"/>On November 7, 2008, FinCEN 
published a proposal to transfer and 
reorganize its regulations as part of an 
ongoing effort to increase the efficiency 
and effectiveness of its regulatory 
oversight.1 Moving the regulations to a 
new chapter within Title 31 provides 
FinCEN with the opportunity to 
restructure its regulations so that they 
can readily be identified as being 
specific to a particular regulated 
industry or as being generally applicable 
to all regulated industries or covered 
persons. FinCEN received eight public 
comments on the Chapter X NPRM, 
<Node id="2807"/>which will be discussed below in the 
Section-by-Section Analysis. 
<Node id="2875"/>Making the regulatory obligations 
more clear in their structure and more 
readily accessible to regulated 
institutions facilitates compliance and 
thereby advances the purposes of the 
BSA. Additionally, the transfer of 
FinCEN&#x2019;s regulations allows for better 
integration with the government-wide 
eRulemaking program. 
<Node id="3198"/>Since publication of the Chapter X 
NPRM, FinCEN has further improved 
public access to its rulemaking and non- 
rulemaking documents. On November 
17, 2009, FinCEN issued a Final Rule 
amending the procedures for publicly 
issuing an administrative ruling relating 
to the BSA.2 Since the effective date of 
that Final Rule (December 17, 2009), 
FinCEN posts administrative rulings 
with precedential value on its Web site, 
rather than publishing them in the 
Federal Register. FinCEN believes that 
posting administrative rulings with 
precedential value on FinCEN&#x2019;s Web 
site will make those rulings easier to 
find. All administrative rulings with 
precedential value will be available by 
mail to any person who makes a written 
request that specifically identifies the 
administrative ruling that is sought. 
<Node id="4014"/>Subsequent to the publication of the 
Chapter X NPRM, FinCEN published 
several final rules, e.g., the 
Administrative Ruling Final Rule. All 
final rules that were published in the 
timeframe between the Chapter X NPRM 
and this Final Rule have been 
incorporated into FinCEN&#x2019;s regulations 
in the Chapter X format. 
<Node id="4332"/>II. Effective Date 
<Node id="4352"/>The effective date of this Final Rule 
will be March 1, 2011. 
<Node id="4415"/>III. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<Node id="4449"/>A. Technical Corrections 
<Node id="4475"/>In the Chapter X NPRM, FinCEN 
proposed to make non-substantive 
technical corrections to the BSA 
implementing regulations. These 
corrections included updating titles and 
offices to represent organizational 
changes within the Treasury 
Department and FinCEN, changing 
mailing addresses, and updating names 
of Federal government agencies. The 
comments that FinCEN received relating 
to the technical corrections were 
comments or suggestions that would 
substantively alter the BSA. Because 
such comments are outside the scope of 
<Node id="5013"/>this rulemaking, FinCEN did not make 
any changes on the basis of those 
comments. 
<Node id="5097"/>On April 14, 2010, FinCEN issued a 
final rule to include mutual funds 
within the general definition of 
&#x2018;&#x2018;financial institution&#x2019;&#x2019; in the BSA 
regulations.3 In that rule, FinCEN 
finalized two definitions of the term 
&#x2018;&#x2018;mutual fund,&#x2019;&#x2019; one for the general 
definition section and the other for the 
anti-money laundering program rules 
for mutual funds.4 Although the two 
definitions contain minor textual 
differences, they were not intended to 
and do not have substantive 
distinctions. Similarly, there are textual 
differences between those two 
definitions and the definition of mutual 
fund used for the regulations 
implementing the Customer 
Identification Program requirements for 
mutual funds. Again, the textual 
differences were not intended to and do 
not signify substantive distinctions. 
Therefore, in order to be consistent and 
eliminate the textual anomalies within 
the various definitions for mutual fund 
that are currently within Part 103, the 
text of the definition of mutual fund 
from the Part 103 Customer 
Identification Programs for Mutual 
Funds will now be used as the 
definition of mutual fund in Chapter X 
for all purposes, except as provided in 
the regulatory text for the special 
measures provisions of Subpart F of the 
General Provisions Part. 
<Node id="6387"/>B. Restructuring and Numbering Logic 
<Node id="6425"/>As discussed in the Chapter X NPRM, 
FinCEN is restructuring its regulations 
to make them more accessible for 
covered individuals and financial 
institutions. Chapter X is comprised of 
a General Provisions Part and separate 
financial institution specific Parts for 
those financial institutions subject to 
FinCEN regulations. The General 
Provisions Part (Part 1010) contains 
regulatory requirements that apply to 
more than one type of financial 
institution, and in some cases, 
individuals. The financial institution 
specific Parts contain regulatory 
requirements specific to a particular 
type of financial institution. Each Part, 
whether general or specific, contains 
similarly titled and ordered Subparts. 
For consistency across all Parts and to 
facilitate ease of reference, FinCEN has 
renumbered its regulations so that the 
same numbering format is used for the 
regulations in each Subpart.

<Node id="7935"/>8 See http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/ 
guidance/2000_2004.html. 
<Node id="8005"/>The comments received by FinCEN 
were generally supportive of FinCEN&#x2019;s 
effort to organize the BSA implementing 
regulations into an easier to follow 
format. Some commenters noted that the 
renumbering format could serve to 
minimize any misunderstanding 
regarding whether a particular industry 
has a specific regulatory requirement. 
<Node id="8343"/>One commenter noted the structure of 
Chapter X is problematic because users 
would be required to refer to both the 
industry-specific Part, as well as the 
General Provisions Part to determine 
regulatory requirements. Some 
commenters noted that a potential 
problem with the structure of Chapter X 
and the location of the definitions is 
that it would require users to flip back 
and forth between Parts to confirm both 
the definitions and requirements. While 
there will be some cross-referencing 
between Parts for financial institutions, 
FinCEN concluded that the structure of 
Chapter X is best for identifying the 
current regulatory requirements for each 
type of financial institution and any 
future regulatory changes. 
<Node id="9079"/>Some commenters requested that all 
definitions be placed in the General 
Provisions Part, thus limiting the need 
for cross-referencing. FinCEN 
considered this suggestion while 
drafting this Final Rule but ultimately 
found the approach unworkable because 
it created large sub-categories of 
definitions that diluted the contextual 
distinction that applies to certain 
defined terms. For example, the 
definition for &#x2018;&#x2018;account,&#x2019;&#x2019; as one 
commenter noted, has several different 
meanings. The reason for these 
definitional differences lies not only 
with the products and services the 
covered institution offers, but also with 
the specific regulatory obligations 
involved. Placing all definitions of 
&#x2018;&#x2018;account&#x2019;&#x2019; in the General Definitions 
Subpart of Part 1010, as requested by 
the commenter, would require several 
sub-definitions to reference the 
applicable regulations. So in the case of 
the term &#x2018;&#x2018;account,&#x2019;&#x2019; by removing 
&#x2018;&#x2018;account&#x2019;&#x2019; from the definition section in 
the rules implementing Section 312 of 
the USA PATRIOT Act and placing 
them in the General Definitions Subpart 
of Part 1010, the needed context as to 
why the definition is different is lost. 
While there may be some cross- 
referencing of definitions with the 
implementation of Chapter X, keeping 
the definitional structure as proposed 
helps provide context as to why words 
are defined differently. 
<Node id="10468"/>Many of the comments FinCEN 
received on the Chapter X NPRM were 
substantive in nature or suggested 
changes that would alter industry 
<Node id="10605"/>regulatory requirements. One 
commenter suggested removing dates in 
the regulations that were perceived as 
no longer relevant, such as the dates in 
the Civil Penalties provisions of the 
previous 31 CFR 103.57. While some 
dates in the regulations appear to be so 
long-standing as to be obsolete, they still 
represent substantive differences in 
compliance obligations and 
corresponding penalties. All comments 
to the Chapter X NPRM that requested 
a substantive change, or would result in 
a substantive change, are considered 
outside the scope of this rulemaking and 
have not been incorporated into this 
Final Rule. 
<Node id="11234"/>C. Removal of Appendices to 31 CFR 
Part 103 
<Node id="11280"/>In the Chapter X NPRM, FinCEN did 
not publish the Appendices in 31 CFR 
Part 103. In the preamble to the Chapter 
X NPRM, FinCEN proposed to publish 
those Appendices that would be 
transferred to Chapter X in a subsequent 
notice of proposed rulemaking. After a 
further review of the Appendices, 
FinCEN determined that it was not 
necessary to issue a second notice of 
proposed rulemaking for the 
Appendices located in 31 CFR Part 103. 
This is because, as described in more 
detail below, FinCEN has determined 
that none of the Appendices will need 
to be included in Chapter X; instead, the 
material contained in the Appendices 
that is still required by the regulations 
will be made available on FinCEN&#x2019;s 
Web site. The following is a description 
of the disposition of each 31 CFR Part 
103 Appendix: 
<Node id="12095"/>Appendix A to 31 CFR Part 103 
<Node id="12126"/>As part of the Administrative Ruling 
Final Rule, certain administrative 
rulings contained in Appendix A to 31 
CFR Part 103 (proposed as Appendix D 
to Chapter X) have been posted on 
FinCEN&#x2019;s Web site and others were 
formally rescinded.5 As stated in the 
preamble to the Administrative Ruling 
Final Rule, some of the administrative 
rulings included in Appendix A to 31 
CFR Part 103 remain FinCEN&#x2019;s 
interpretation of the applicable rules 
and maintain their precedential value; 
therefore, those rulings have been 
posted to the FinCEN Web site. Because 
FinCEN has chosen to post 
administrative rulings on its public Web 
site, FinCEN will not be publishing the 
proposed Appendix D to Chapter X in 
this Final Rule. In the Administrative 
Ruling Final Rule, FinCEN did not 
<Node id="12911"/>indicate whether Administrative Ruling 
88&#x2013;2 would be posted on the FinCEN 
public Web site or rescinded. 
Administrative Ruling 88&#x2013;2 has been 
posted on the FinCEN public Web site. 
The disposition of this particular ruling 
was inadvertently omitted from the 
Administrative Ruling Final Rule. 
<Node id="13208"/>Appendix B to 31 CFR Part 103 
<Node id="13239"/>The requirement for a financial 
institution to provide FinCEN with the 
certification currently found in 
Appendix B to 31 CFR Part 103 
(Certification for Purposes of Section 
314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act and 31 
CFR 103.110) prior to sharing 
information under 31 CFR 103.110 (new 
31 CFR 1010.540) was replaced in 
September 2002 with a requirement to 
provide notice to FinCEN prior to such 
information sharing.6 Although the 
certification requirement was replaced 
with a notice requirement, the 
Certification contained at Appendix B to 
31 CFR Part 103 was not removed from 
the CFR. FinCEN&#x2019;s removal of the 
Certification in this Final Rule is a 
technical correction, rather than a 
substantive change. The Certification 
contained at Appendix B to 31 CFR Part 
103 will not be transferred to Chapter X 
and the Certification will not be made 
available on FinCEN&#x2019;s public Web site. 
As indicated above, financial 
institutions providing notice to FinCEN 
prior to sharing information under new 
31 CFR 1010.540 shall continue to do so 
using the notice that is currently 
provided on FinCEN&#x2019;s public Web site.7 
<Node id="14365"/>Appendix C to 31 CFR Part 103 
<Node id="14396"/>For similar reasons, FinCEN is 
removing Appendix C to 31 CFR Part 
103 (proposed Appendix E to Chapter 
X). The interpretative guidance 
contained within Appendix C to 31 CFR 
Part 103 are posted on FinCEN&#x2019;s public 
Web site and will not be published in 
the CFR.8 
<Node id="14663"/>Appendix A to Subpart H of 31 CFR Part 
103 
<Node id="14708"/>Appendix A to Subpart H of 31 CFR 
Part 103 contains the Notice for 
Purposes of Subsection 314(b) of the 
USA Patriot Act and 31 CFR 103.110. 
This Notice is currently available on the 
FinCEN public Web site and will not be 
published in the Code of Federal 
Regulations as part of Chapter X.

Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, a 
regulatory impact analysis is not 
required. 
<Node id="45911"/>B. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
<Node id="45953"/>Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(&#x2018;&#x2018;Unfunded Mandates Act&#x2019;&#x2019;), Public Law 
104&#x2013;4 (March 22, 1995), requires that an 
agency prepare a budgetary impact 
statement before promulgating a rule 
that may result in expenditure by state, 
local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100 million or more in any one year. 
If a budgetary impact statement is 
required, section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Act also requires an agency to 
identify and consider a reasonable 
number of regulatory alternatives before 
promulgating a rule. FinCEN has 
determined that it is not required to 
prepare a written statement under 
Section 202 and has concluded that on 
balance the rule provides the most cost- 
effective and least burdensome 
alternative to achieve the objectives of 
the rule. 
<Node id="46795"/>C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<Node id="46826"/>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 602 et seq.), FinCEN 
certifies that this final regulation likely 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The regulatory changes in this 
final rule merely restructure and re- 
codify existing regulations and do not 
alter current regulatory obligations. 
<Node id="47192"/>FinCEN believes the costs that may 
arise as a result of restructuring these 
regulations will be confined to training, 
publication and computer programming. 
The new regulatory structure will 
require financial institution compliance 
personnel to be retrained to assure 
familiarity with the new numbering 
format but does not require changes to 
program, recordkeeping, or reporting 
requirements. FinCEN has attempted to 
mitigate any substantial costs of 
retraining by providing a Distribution 
Table. 
<Node id="47702"/>Publication costs incurred to 
reproduce informational materials 
supplied by financial institutions to 
customers and the public should be 
minimized by the time interval afforded 
between the proposed rule, analysis and 
publication of this final rule. 
<Node id="47958"/>FinCEN&#x2019;s analysis of the small entities 
that are subject to this regulation 
indicates that the vast majority of such 
entities file paper reports with FinCEN. 
<Node id="48120"/>These entities should incur no 
additional filing costs because they will 
continue to obtain the most current 
copy of the form available on the 
FinCEN Web site to file a report. For 
financial institutions that file 
electronically using computer programs, 
the citation to Chapter X should not 
have an effect on completion of the 
required fields contained in FinCEN 
forms. As an example, FinCEN&#x2019;s Form 
104, the Currency Transaction Report, 
will require the same completion of 
each field in the same order. While the 
underlying regulatory citations may be 
changing, the completion of FinCEN 
forms will not. 
<Node id="48740"/>D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<Node id="48768"/>This regulation contains no new 
information collection requirements 
subject to review and approval by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3507(d) et seq.). The 
information collection requirements for 
the Bank Secrecy Act, currently codified 
at 31 CFR Part 103, were previously 
approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget under OMB Control 
numbers 1506&#x2013;0001 through 1506&#x2013; 
0046. Under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act, an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor and a person is not required to 
respond to a collection of information

business. 
<Node id="97458"/>(a) Reporting requirement&#x2014;(1) 
Reportable transactions&#x2014;(i) In general. 
Any person (solely for purposes of 
section 5331 of title 31, United States 
Code and this section, &#x2018;&#x2018;person&#x2019;&#x2019; shall 
have the same meaning as under 26 
U.S.C.7701(a)(1)) who, in the course of 
a trade or business in which such 
person is engaged, receives currency in 
excess of $10,000 in 1 transaction (or 
2 or more related transactions) shall, 
except as otherwise provided, make a 
report of information with respect to the 
receipt of currency. This section does 
not apply to amounts received in a 
transaction reported under 31 U.S.C. 
5313 and  1010.311, 1010.313, 
1020.315, 1021.311 or 1021.313 of this 
chapter.<Node id="98156"/> 
<Node id="98158"/>(ii) Certain financial transactions. 
Section 6050I of title 26 of the United 
States Code requires persons to report 
information about financial transactions 
to the IRS, and 31 U.S.C. 5331 requires 
persons to report similar information 
about certain transactions to FinCEN. 
This information shall be reported on 
the same form as prescribed by the 
Secretary. <Node id="98524"/>
<Node id="98525"/>(2) Currency received for the account 
of another. Currency in excess of 
$10,000 received by a person for the 
account of another must be reported 
under this section. Thus, for example, a 
person who collects delinquent 
accounts receivable for an automobile 
dealer must report with respect to the 
receipt of currency in excess of $10,000 
from the collection of a particular 
account even though the proceeds of the 
collection are credited to the account of 
the automobile dealer (i.e., where the 
rights to the proceeds from the account 
are retained by the automobile dealer 
and the collection is made on a fee-for- 
service basis). <Node id="99168"/>
<Node id="99169"/>(3) Currency received by agents&#x2014; 
(i) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a 
person who in the course of a trade or 
business acts as an agent (or in some 
other similar capacity) and receives 
currency in excess of $10,000 from a 
<Node id="99440"/>principal must report the receipt of 
currency under this section<Node id="99505"/>.<Node id="99506"/> 
<Node id="99508"/>(ii) Exception. An agent who receives 
currency from a principal and uses all 
of the currency within 15 days in a 
currency transaction (the &#x2018;&#x2018;second 
currency transaction&#x2019;&#x2019;) which is 
reportable under section 5312 of title 31, 
or 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section, and 
who discloses the name, address, and 
TIN of the principal to the recipient in 
the second currency transaction need 
not report the initial receipt of currency 
under this section. An agent will be 
deemed to have met the disclosure 
requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) 
if the agent discloses only the name of 
the principal and the agent knows that 
the recipient has the principal&#x2019;s address 
and taxpayer identification number.<Node id="100216"/> <Node id="100217"/>
<Node id="100218"/>(iii) Example. The following example 
illustrates the application of the rules in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this 
section: 
<Node id="100350"/>Example. B, the principal, gives D, an 
attorney, $75,000 in currency to purchase 
real property on behalf of B. Within 15 days 
D purchases real property for currency from 
E, a real estate developer, and discloses to E, 
B&#x2019;s name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number. Because the 
transaction qualifies for the exception 
provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section, D need not report with respect to the 
initial receipt of currency under this section. 
The exception does not apply, however, if D 
pays E by means other than currency, or 
effects the purchase more than 15 days 
following receipt of the currency from B, or 
fails to disclose B&#x2019;s name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number (assuming D 
does not know that E already has B&#x2019;s address 
and taxpayer identification number), or 
purchases the property from a person whose 
sale of the property is not in the course of 
that person&#x2019;s trade or business. In any such 
case, D is required to report the receipt of 
currency from B under this section. <Node id="101385"/>
<Node id="101386"/>(b) Multiple payments. The receipt of 
multiple currency deposits or currency 
installment payments (or other similar 
payments or prepayments) relating to a 
single transaction (or two or more 
related transactions), is reported as set 
forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) 
of this section.

<Node id="102515"/>(3) Subsequent payments. In addition 
to any other required report, a report 
must be made each time that previously 
unreportable payments made within a 
12-month period with respect to a single 
transaction (or two or more related 
transactions), individually or in the 
aggregate, exceed $10,000. The report 
must be made within 15 days after 
receiving the payment in excess of 
$10,000 or the payment that causes the 
aggregate amount received in the 12- 
month period to exceed $10,000. (If 
more than one report would otherwise 
be required for multiple currency 
payments within a 15-day period that 
relate to a single transaction (or two or 
more related transactions), the recipient 
may make a single combined report 
with respect to the payments. The 
combined report must be made no later 
than the date by which the first of the 
separate reports would otherwise be 
required to be made.) <Node id="103419"/>
<Node id="103420"/>(4) Example. The following example 
illustrates the application of the rules in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section: 
<Node id="103553"/>Example. On January 10, Year 1, M 
receives an initial payment in currency of 
$11,000 with respect to a transaction. M 
receives subsequent payments in currency 
with respect to the same transaction of 
$4,000 on February 15, Year 1, $6,000 on 
March 20, Year 1, and $12,000 on May 15, 
Year 1. M must make a report with respect 
to the payment received on January 10, Year 
1, by January 25, Year 1. M must also make 
a report with respect to the payments totaling 
$22,000 received from February 15, Year 1, 
through May 15, Year 1. This report must be 
made by May 30, Year 1, that is, within 15 
days of the date that the subsequent 
payments, all of which were received within 
a 12-month period, exceeded $10,000.<Node id="104273"/> <Node id="104274"/>
<Node id="104275"/>(c) Meaning of terms. The following 
definitions apply for purposes of this 
section&#x2014; 
<Node id="104362"/>(1) Currency. Solely for purposes of 31 
U.S.C. 5331 and this section, currency 
means&#x2014; 
<Node id="104451"/>(i) The coin and currency of the 
United States or of any other country, 
which circulate in and are customarily 
used and accepted as money in the 
country in which issued; and 
<Node id="104630"/>(ii) A cashier&#x2019;s check (by whatever 
name called, including &#x2018;&#x2018;treasurer&#x2019;s 
check&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x2018;bank check&#x2019;&#x2019;), bank draft, 
traveler&#x2019;s check, or money order having 
a face amount of not more than 
$10,000&#x2014; 
<Node id="104830"/>(A) Received in a designated reporting 
transaction as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section (except as provided 
in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (5) of this 
section), or 
<Node id="105009"/>(B) Received in any transaction in 
which the recipient knows that such 
instrument is being used in an attempt 
to avoid the reporting of the transaction 
under section 5331 and this section. 
<Node id="105203"/>(2) Designated reporting transaction. 
A designated reporting transaction is a 
retail sale (or the receipt of funds by a 
broker or other intermediary in 
connection with a retail sale) of&#x2014; 
<Node id="105395"/>(i) A consumer durable, 
(ii) A collectible, or 
(iii) A travel or entertainment activity. 
(3) Exception for certain loans. A 
<Node id="105523"/>cashier&#x2019;s check, bank draft, traveler&#x2019;s 
check, or money order received in a 
designated reporting transaction is not 
treated as currency pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if 
the instrument constitutes the proceeds 
of a loan from a bank. The recipient may 
rely on a copy of the loan document, a 
written statement from the bank, or 
similar documentation (such as a 
written lien instruction from the issuer 
of the instrument) to substantiate that 
the instrument constitutes loan 
proceeds. 
<Node id="106040"/>(4) Exception for certain installment 
sales. A cashier&#x2019;s check, bank draft, 
traveler&#x2019;s check, or money order 
received in a designated reporting 
transaction is not treated as currency 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section if the instrument is received 
in payment on a promissory note or an 
installment sales contract (including a 
lease that is considered to be a sale for 
Federal income tax purposes). However, 
the preceding sentence applies only if&#x2014; 
<Node id="106516"/>(i) Promissory notes or installment 
sales contracts with the same or 
substantially similar terms are used in 
the ordinary course of the recipient&#x2019;s 
trade or business in connection with 
sales to ultimate consumers; and 
<Node id="106740"/>(ii) The total amount of payments 
with respect to the sale that are received 
on or before the 60th day after the date 
of the sale does not exceed 50 percent 
of the purchase price of the sale. 
<Node id="106937"/>(5) Exception for certain down 
payment plans. A cashier&#x2019;s check, bank 
draft, traveler&#x2019;s check, or money order 
received in a designated reporting 
transaction is not treated as currency 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section if the instrument is received 
pursuant to a payment plan requiring 
one or more down payments and the 
payment of the balance of the purchase 
price by a date no later than the date of 
the sale (in the case of an item of travel 
or entertainment, a date no later than 
the earliest date that any item of travel 
or entertainment pertaining to the same 
trip or event is furnished). However, the 
preceding sentence applies only if&#x2014; 
<Node id="107614"/>(i) The recipient uses payment plans 
with the same or substantially similar 
terms in the ordinary course of its trade 
or business in connection with sales to 
ultimate consumers; and 
<Node id="107801"/>(ii) The instrument is received more 
than 60 days prior to the date of the sale 
(in the case of an item of travel or 
entertainment, the date on which the 
final payment is due). 
<Node id="107983"/>(6) Examples. The following examples 
illustrate the definition of &#x2018;&#x2018;currency&#x2019;&#x2019; set 
forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) 
of this section: 
<Node id="108129"/>Example 1. D, an individual, purchases 
gold coins from M, a coin dealer, for $13,200. 
D tenders to M in payment United States 
currency in the amount of $6,200 and a 
cashier&#x2019;s check in the face amount of $7,000 
which D had purchased. Because the sale is 
a designated reporting transaction, the 
cashier&#x2019;s check is treated as currency for 
purposes of 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section. 
Therefore, because M has received more than 
$10,000 in currency with respect to the 
transaction, M must make the report required 
by 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section. 
<Node id="108688"/>Example 2. E, an individual, purchases an 
automobile from Q, an automobile dealer, for 
$11,500. E tenders to Q in payment United 
States currency in the amount of $2,000 and 
a cashier&#x2019;s check payable to E and Q in the 
amount of $9,500. The cashier&#x2019;s check 
constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the 
bank issuing the check. The origin of the 
proceeds is evident from provisions inserted 
by the bank on the check that instruct the 
dealer to cause a lien to be placed on the 
vehicle as security for the loan. The sale of 
the automobile is a designated reporting 
transaction. However, under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, because E has furnished Q 
documentary information establishing that 
the cashier&#x2019;s check constitutes the proceeds 
of a loan from the bank issuing the check, the 
cashier&#x2019;s check is not treated as currency 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section. 
<Node id="109586"/>Example 3. F, an individual, purchases an 
item of jewelry from S, a retail jeweler, for 
$12,000. F gives S traveler&#x2019;s checks totaling 
$2,400 and pays the balance with a personal 
check payable to S in the amount of $9,600. 
Because the sale is a designated reporting 
transaction, the traveler&#x2019;s checks are treated 
as currency for purposes of section 5331 and 
this section. However, because the personal 
check is not treated as currency for purposes 
of section 5331 and this section, S has not 
received more than $10,000 in currency in 
the transaction and no report is required to 
be filed under section 5331 and this section. 
<Node id="110224"/>Example 4. G, an individual, purchases a 
boat from T, a boat dealer, for $16,500. G 
pays T with a cashier&#x2019;s check payable to T 
in the amount of $16,500. The cashier&#x2019;s 
check is not treated as currency because the 
face amount of the check is more than 
$10,000. Thus, no report is required to be 
made by T under section 5331 and this 
section.

W, a travel agent, for the chartering of a 
passenger aircraft to transport a group of

<Node id="110968"/>individuals to a sports event in another city. 
H also arranges with W for hotel 
accommodations for the group and for 
admission tickets to the sports event. In 
payment, H tenders to W money orders 
which H had previously purchased. The total 
amount of the money orders, none of which 
individually exceeds $10,000 in face amount, 
exceeds $10,000. Because the transaction is 
a designated reporting transaction, the money 
orders are treated as currency for purposes of 
section 5331 and this section. Therefore, 
because W has received more than $10,000 
in currency with respect to the transaction, 
W must make the report required by section 
5331 and this section. 
<Node id="111642"/>(7) Consumer durable. The term 
consumer durable means an item of 
tangible personal property of a type that 
is suitable under ordinary usage for 
personal consumption or use, that can 
reasonably be expected to be useful for 
at least 1 year under ordinary usage, and 
that has a sales price of more than 
$10,000. Thus, for example, a $20,000 
automobile is a consumer durable 
(whether or not it is sold for business 
use), but a $20,000 dump truck or a 
$20,000 factory machine is not. 
<Node id="112134"/>(8) Collectible. The term collectible 
means an item described in paragraphs 
(A) through (D) of section 408 (m)(2) of 
title 26 of the United States Code 
(determined without regard to section 
408 (m)(3) of title 26 of the United 
States Code). 
<Node id="112382"/>(9) Travel or entertainment activity. 
The term travel or entertainment 
activity means an item of travel or 
entertainment (within the meaning of 26 
CFR 1.274&#x2013;2(b)(1)) pertaining to a single 
trip or event where the aggregate sales 
price of the item and all other items 
pertaining to the same trip or event that 
are sold in the same transaction (or 
related transactions) exceeds $10,000. 
<Node id="112777"/>(10) Retail sale. The term retail sale 
means any sale (whether for resale or for 
any other purpose) made in the course 
of a trade or business if that trade or 
business principally consists of making 
sales to ultimate consumers. 
<Node id="113011"/>(11) Trade or business. The term trade 
or business has the same meaning as 
under section 162 of title 26, United 
States Code. 
<Node id="113141"/>(12) Transaction. (i) Solely for 
purposes of 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this 
section, the term transaction means the 
underlying event precipitating the 
payer&#x2019;s transfer of currency to the 
recipient. In this context, transactions 
include (but are not limited to) a sale of 
goods or services; a sale of real property; 
a sale of intangible property; a rental of 
real or personal property; an exchange 
of currency for other currency; the 
establishment or maintenance of or 
contribution to a custodial, trust, or 
escrow arrangement; a payment of a 
<Node id="113690"/>preexisting debt; a conversion of 
currency to a negotiable instrument; a 
reimbursement for expenses paid; or the 
making or repayment of a loan. A 
transaction may not be divided into 
multiple transactions in order to avoid 
reporting under this section. 
<Node id="113949"/>(ii) The term related transactions 
means any transaction conducted 
between a payer (or its agent) and a 
recipient of currency in a 24-hour 
period. Additionally, transactions 
conducted between a payer (or its agent) 
and a currency recipient during a period 
of more than 24 hours are related if the 
recipient knows or has reason to know 
that each transaction is one of a series 
of connected transactions. 
<Node id="114363"/>(iii) The following examples illustrate 
the definition of paragraphs (c)(12)(i) 
and (ii) of this section: 
<Node id="114472"/>Example 1. A person has a tacit agreement 
with a gold dealer to purchase $36,000 in 
gold bullion. The $36,000 purchase 
represents a single transaction under 
paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section and the 
reporting requirements of this section cannot 
be avoided by recasting the single sales 
transaction into 4 separate $9,000 sales 
transactions. 
<Node id="114825"/>Example 2. An attorney agrees to represent 
a client in a criminal case with the attorney&#x2019;s 
fee to be determined on an hourly basis. In 
the first month in which the attorney 
represents the client, the bill for the 
attorney&#x2019;s services comes to $8,000 which the 
client pays in currency. In the second month 
in which the attorney represents the client, 
the bill for the attorney&#x2019;s services comes to 
$4,000, which the client again pays in 
currency. The aggregate amount of currency 
paid ($12,000) relates to a single transaction 
as defined in paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this 
section, the sale of legal services relating to 
the criminal case, and the receipt of currency 
must be reported under this section. 
<Node id="115540"/>Example 3. A person intends to contribute 
a total of $45,000 to a trust fund, and the 
trustee of the fund knows or has reason to 
know of that intention. The $45,000 
contribution is a single transaction under 
paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section and the 
reporting requirement of this section cannot 
be avoided by the grantor&#x2019;s making five 
separate $9,000 contributions of currency to 
a single fund or by making five $9,000 
contributions of currency to five separate 
funds administered by a common trustee. 
<Node id="116057"/>Example 4. K, an individual, attends a one 
day auction and purchases for currency two 
items, at a cost of $9,240 and $1,732.50 
respectively (tax and buyer&#x2019;s premium 
included). Because the transactions are 
related transactions as defined in paragraph 
(c)(12)(ii) of this section, the auction house 
is required to report the aggregate amount of 
currency received from the related sales 
($10,972.50), even though the auction house 
accounts separately on its books for each 
item sold and presents the purchaser with 
separate bills for each item purchased. 
<Node id="116622"/>Example 5. F, a coin dealer, sells for 
currency $9,000 worth of gold coins to an 
<Node id="116705"/>individual on three successive days. Under 
paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section the three 
$9,000 transactions are related transactions 
aggregating $27,000 if F knows, or has reason 
to know, that each transaction is one of a 
series of connected transactions. 
<Node id="116970"/>(13) Recipient. (i) The term recipient 
means the person receiving the 
currency. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(13)(ii) of this section, each 
store, division, branch, department, 
headquarters, or office (&#x2018;&#x2018;branch&#x2019;&#x2019;) 
(regardless of physical location) 
comprising a portion of a person&#x2019;s trade 
or business shall for purposes of this 
section be deemed a separate recipient. 
<Node id="117354"/>(ii) A branch that receives currency 
payments will not be deemed a separate 
recipient if the branch (or a central unit 
linking such branch with other 
branches) would in the ordinary course 
of business have reason to know the 
identity of payers making currency 
payments to other branches of such 
person. 
<Node id="117666"/>(iii) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the application of 
the rules in paragraphs (c)(13)(i) and (ii) 
of this section: 
<Node id="117800"/>Example 1. N, an individual, purchases 
regulated futures contracts at a cost of $7,500 
and $5,000, respectively, through two 
different branches of Commodities Broker X 
on the same day. N pays for each purchase 
with currency. Each branch of Commodities 
Broker X transmits the sales information 
regarding each of N&#x2019;s purchases to a central 
unit of Commodities Broker X (which settles 
the transactions against N&#x2019;s account). Under 
paragraph (c)(13)(ii) of this section the 
separate branches of Commodities Broker X 
are not deemed to be separate recipients; 
therefore, Commodities Broker X must report 
with respect to the two related regulated 
futures contracts sales in accordance with 
this section. 
<Node id="118513"/>Example 2. P, a corporation, owns and 
operates a racetrack. P&#x2019;s racetrack contains 
100 betting windows at which pari-mutuel 
wagers may be made. R, an individual, places 
currency wagers of $3,000 each at five 
separate betting windows. Assuming that in 
the ordinary course of business each betting 
window (or a central unit linking windows) 
does not have reason to know the identity of 
persons making wagers at other betting 
windows, each betting window would be 
deemed to be a separate currency recipient 
under paragraph (c)(13)(i) of this section. As 
no individual recipient received currency in 
excess of $10,000, no report need be made by 
P under this section.<Node id="119190"/> <Node id="119191"/>
<Node id="119192"/>(d) Exceptions to the reporting 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5331&#x2014;(1) 
Receipt is made with respect to a foreign 
currency transaction&#x2014;(i) In general. 
Generally, there is no requirement to 
report with respect to a currency 
transaction if the entire transaction 
occurs outside the United States (the 
fifty states and the District of Columbia).

<Node id="119802"/>An entire transaction consists of both 
the transaction as defined in paragraph 
(c)(12)(i) of this section and the receipt 
of currency by the recipient. If, 
however, any part of an entire 
transaction occurs in the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a 
possession or territory of the United 
States and the recipient of currency in 
that transaction is subject to the general 
jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue 
Service under title 26 of the United 
States Code, the recipient is required to 
report the transaction under this 
section. <Node id="120342"/>
<Node id="120343"/>(ii) Example. The following example 
illustrates the application of the rules in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section: 
<Node id="120463"/>Example. W, an individual engaged in the 
trade or business of selling aircraft, reaches 
an agreement to sell an airplane to a U.S. 
citizen living in Mexico. The agreement, no 
portion of which is formulated in the United 
States, calls for a purchase price of $125,000 
and requires delivery of and payment for the 
airplane to be made in Mexico. Upon 
delivery of the airplane in Mexico, W 
receives $125,000 in currency. W is not 
required to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or 
this section because the exception provided 
in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (&#x2018;&#x2018;foreign 
transaction exception&#x2019;&#x2019;) applies. If, however, 
any part of the agreement to sell had been 
formulated in the United States, the foreign 
transaction exception would not apply and 
W would be required to report the receipt of 
currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this 
section<Node id="121313"/>.<Node id="121314"/> 
<Node id="121316"/>(2) Receipt of currency not in the 
course of the recipient&#x2019;s trade or 
business. The receipt of currency in 
excess of $10,000 by a person other than 
in the course of the person&#x2019;s trade or 
business is not reportable under 31 
U.S.C. 5331. Thus, for example, F, an 
individual in the trade or business of 
selling real estate, sells a motorboat for 
$12,000, the purchase price of which is 
paid in currency. F did not use the 
motorboat in any trade or business in 
which F was engaged. F is not required 
to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or this 
section because the exception provided 
in this paragraph (d)(2) applies<Node id="121937"/>. 
<Node id="121940"/>(e) Time, manner, and form of 
reporting&#x2014;(1) In general. The reports 
required by paragraph (a) of this section 
must be made by filing a Form 8300, as 
specified in 26 CFR 1.6050I&#x2013;1(e)(2). The 
reports must be filed at the time and in 
the manner specified in 26 CFR 
1.6050I&#x2013;1(e)(1) and (3) respectively. <Node id="122247"/>
<Node id="122248"/>(2) Verification. A person making a 
report of information under this section 
must verify the identity of the person 
from whom the reportable currency is 
received. Verification of the identity of 
a person who purports to be an alien

of the identity of an individual who 
indicates that he or she is an alien or is 
not a resident of the United States may 
be made by passport, alien 
identification card, or other official 
document evidencing nationality or 
residence (e.g., a foreign driver&#x2019;s license

<Node id="166365"/> 1010.520 Information sharing between 
government agencies and financial 
institutions. 
<Node id="166455"/>(a) Definitions. For purposes of this 
section: 
<Node id="166504"/>(1) Financial institution means any 
financial institution described in 31 
U.S.C. 5312(a)(2). 
<Node id="166600"/>(2) Law enforcement agency means a 
Federal, State, local, or foreign law 
enforcement agency with criminal 
investigative authority, provided that in 
the case of a foreign law enforcement 
agency, such agency is from a 
jurisdiction that is a party to a treaty 
that provides, or in the determination of 
FinCEN is from a jurisdiction that 
otherwise allows, law enforcement 
agencies in the United States reciprocal 
access to information comparable to that 
obtained under this section<Node id="167089"/>. 
<Node id="167092"/>(b) Information requests based on 
credible evidence concerning terrorist 
activity or money laundering&#x2014;(1) In 
general. A law enforcement agency 
investigating terrorist activity or money 
laundering may request that FinCEN 
solicit, on the investigating agency&#x2019;s 
behalf, certain information from a 
financial institution or a group of 
financial institutions. When submitting 
such a request to FinCEN, the law 
enforcement agency shall provide 
FinCEN with a written certification, in 
such form and manner as FinCEN may 
prescribe. At a minimum, such 
certification must: State that each 
individual, entity, or organization about 
which the law enforcement agency is 
seeking information is engaged in, or is 
reasonably suspected based on credible 
evidence of engaging in, terrorist 
activity or money laundering; include 
enough specific identifiers, such as date 
of birth, address, and social security 
number, that would permit a financial 
institution to differentiate between 
common or similar names; and identify 
one person at the agency who can be 
contacted with any questions relating to 
its request. Upon receiving the requisite 
certification from the requesting law 
enforcement agency, FinCEN may 
require any financial institution to 
search its records to determine whether 
the financial institution maintains or 
has maintained accounts for, or has 
engaged in transactions with, any 
specified individual, entity, or 
organization<Node id="168552"/>. 
<Node id="168555"/>(2) Requests from FinCEN. FinCEN 
may solicit, on its own behalf and on 
<Node id="168628"/>behalf of appropriate components of the 
Department of the Treasury, whether a 
financial institution or a group of 
financial institutions maintains or has 
maintained accounts for, or has engaged 
in transactions with, any specified 
individual, entity, or organization. 
Before an information request under this 
section is made to a financial 
institution, FinCEN or the appropriate 
Treasury component shall certify in 
writing in the same manner as a 
requesting law enforcement agency that 
each individual, entity or organization 
about which FinCEN or the appropriate 
Treasury component is seeking 
information is engaged in, or is 
reasonably suspected based on credible 
evidence of engaging in, terrorist 
activity or money laundering. The 
certification also must include enough 
specific identifiers, such as date of birth, 
address, and social security number, 
that would permit a financial institution 
to differentiate between common or 
similar names, and identify one person 
at FinCEN or the appropriate Treasury 
component who can be contacted with 
any questions relating to its request.<Node id="169739"/> 
<Node id="169741"/>(3) Obligations of a financial 
institution receiving an information 
request&#x2014;(i) Record search. Upon 
receiving an information request from 
FinCEN under this section, a financial 
institution shall expeditiously search its 
records to determine whether it 
maintains or has maintained any 
account for, or has engaged in any 
transaction with, each individual, 
entity, or organization named in 
FinCEN&#x2019;s request. A financial 
institution may contact the law 
enforcement agency, FinCEN or 
requesting Treasury component 
representative, or U.S. law enforcement 
attache in the case of a request by a 
foreign law enforcement agency, which 
has been named in the information 
request provided to the institution by 
FinCEN with any questions relating to 
the scope or terms of the request. Except 
as otherwise provided in the 
information request, a financial 
institution shall only be required to 
search its records for: 
<Node id="170670"/>(A) Any current account maintained 
for a named suspect; 
<Node id="170728"/>(B) Any account maintained for a 
named suspect during the preceding 
twelve months; and 
<Node id="170818"/>(C) Any transaction, as defined by

behalf of a named suspect, or any 
transmittal of funds conducted in which 
a named suspect was either the 
transmittor or the recipient, during the 
preceding six months that is required 
under law or regulation to be recorded 
by the financial institution or is 
<Node id="171154"/>recorded and maintained electronically 
by the institution.<Node id="171213"/> 
<Node id="171215"/>(ii) Report to FinCEN. If a financial 
institution identifies an account or 
transaction identified with any 
individual, entity, or organization 
named in a request from FinCEN, it 
shall report to FinCEN, in the manner 
and in the time frame specified in 
FinCEN&#x2019;s request, the following 
information: 
<Node id="171520"/>(A) The name of such individual, 
entity, or organization; 
<Node id="171580"/>(B) The number of each such account, 
or in the case of a transaction, the date 
and type of each such transaction; and

provided by the individual, entity, or 
organization when each such account 
was opened or each such transaction 
was conducted.<Node id="171979"/> <Node id="171980"/>
<Node id="171981"/>(iii) Designation of contact person. 
Upon receiving an information request 
under this section, a financial 
institution shall designate one person to 
be the point of contact at the institution 
regarding the request and to receive 
similar requests for information from 
FinCEN in the future. When requested 
by FinCEN, a financial institution shall 
provide FinCEN with the name, title, 
mailing address, e-mail address, 
telephone number, and facsimile 
number of such person, in such manner 
as FinCEN may prescribe. A financial 
institution that has provided FinCEN 
with contact information must promptly 
notify FinCEN of any changes to such 
information.<Node id="172645"/> 
<Node id="172647"/>(iv) Use and security of information 
request. (A) A financial institution shall 
not use information provided by 
FinCEN pursuant to this section for any 
purpose other than: 
<Node id="172824"/>(1) Reporting to FinCEN as provided 
in this section; 
<Node id="172879"/>(2) Determining whether to establish 
or maintain an account, or to engage in 
a transaction; or 
<Node id="172977"/>(3) Assisting the financial institution 
in complying with any requirement of 
this chapter. <Node id="173070"/>
<Node id="173071"/>(B)(1) A financial institution shall not 
disclose to any person, other than 
FinCEN or the requesting Treasury 
component, the law enforcement agency 
on whose behalf FinCEN is requesting 
information, or U.S. law enforcement 
attache in the case of a request by a 
foreign law enforcement agency, which 
has been named in the information 
request, the fact that FinCEN has 
requested or has obtained information 
under this section, except to the extent 
necessary to comply with such an 
information request<Node id="173582"/>.<Node id="173583"/> <Node id="173584"/>

<Node id="173848"/>(<Node id="173849"/>2) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, a financial 
institution authorized to share 
information under  1010.540 may share 
information concerning an individual, 
entity, or organization named in a 
request from FinCEN in accordance 
with the requirements of such section. 
However, such sharing shall not 
disclose the fact that FinCEN has 
requested information concerning such

<Node id="174294"/>(C) Each financial institution shall 
maintain adequate procedures to protect 
the security and confidentiality of 
requests from FinCEN for information 
under this section. The requirements of 
this paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) shall be 
deemed satisfied to the extent that a 
financial institution applies to such 
information procedures that the 
institution has established to satisfy the 
requirements of section 501 of the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 
6801), and applicable regulations issued 
thereunder, with regard to the 
protection of its customers&#x2019; nonpublic 
personal information.<Node id="174889"/> <Node id="174890"/>
<Node id="174891"/>(v) No other action required. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to 
require a financial institution to take 
any action, or to decline to take any 
action, with respect to an account 
established for, or a transaction engaged 
in with, an individual, entity, or 
organization named in a request from 
FinCEN, or to decline to establish an 
account for, or to engage in a transaction 
with, any such individual, entity, or 
organization. Except as otherwise 
provided in an information request 
under this section, such a request shall 
not require a financial institution to 
report on future account opening 
activity or transactions or to treat a 
suspect list received under this section 
as a government list for purposes of 
section 326 of Public Law 107&#x2013;56.<Node id="175664"/> <Node id="175665"/>
<Node id="175666"/>(4) Relation to the Right to Financial

financial institutions that FinCEN has 
designated as ineligible to share 
information under this section. 
<Node id="177234"/>(2) Association of financial 
institutions means a group or 
organization the membership of which 
is comprised entirely of financial 
institutions as defined in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. <Node id="177431"/>
<Node id="177432"/>(b) Voluntary information sharing 
among financial institutions&#x2014;(1) In

financial institutions must take 
reasonable steps to verify that the other 
financial institution or association of 
financial institutions with which it

submitted to FinCEN the notice required 
by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A 
financial institution or an association of 
financial institutions may satisfy this

<Node id="182139"/>(c) Information sharing between 
financial institutions and the Federal 
Government. If, as a result of 
information shared pursuant to this 
section, a financial institution knows, 
suspects, or has reason to suspect that 
an individual, entity, or organization is 
involved in, or may be involved in 
terrorist activity or money laundering, 
and such institution is subject to a 
suspicious activity reporting 
requirement under this chapter or other 
applicable regulations, the institution 
shall file a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with those regulations. In 
situations involving violations requiring 
immediate attention, such as when a 
reportable violation involves terrorist 
activity or is ongoing, the financial 
institution shall immediately notify, by 
telephone, an appropriate law 
enforcement authority and financial 
institution supervisory authorities in 
addition to filing timely a Suspicious 
Activity Report. A financial institution 
that is not subject to a suspicious 
activity reporting requirement is not 
required to file a Suspicious Activity 
Report or otherwise to notify law 
enforcement of suspicious activity that 
is detected as a result of information 
shared pursuant to this section. Such a 
financial institution is encouraged, 
however, to voluntarily report such 
activity to FinCEN. <Node id="183477"/>
<Node id="183478"/>(d) No effect on financial institution 
reporting obligations. Nothing in this 
subpart affects the obligation of a

the account or the entitlement to the 
funds of the account alone, however, 
without any corresponding authority to 
control, manage or direct the account 
(such as in the case of a minor child 
beneficiary), does not cause the

interpretation. <Node id="250357"/>
<Node id="250358"/>(c) FinCEN shall modify an existing

<Node id="285667"/> 1020.220 Customer Identification 
Programs for banks, savings associations, 
credit unions, and certain non-Federally 
regulated banks. 
<Node id="285806"/>(a) Customer Identification Program: 
minimum requirements&#x2014;(1) In general. 
A bank must implement a written 
Customer Identification Program (CIP) 
appropriate for its size and type of 
business that, at a minimum, includes 
each of the requirements of paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (5) of this section. If a 
bank is required to have an anti-money 
laundering compliance program under 
the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 
5318(h), 12 U.S.C. 1818(s), or 12 U.S.C. 
1786(q)(1), then the CIP must be a part 
of the anti-money laundering 
compliance program. Until such time as 
credit unions, private banks, and trust 
companies without a Federal functional 
regulator are subject to such a program, 
their CIPs must be approved by their 
boards of directors. 
<Node id="286566"/>(2) Identity verification procedures. 
The CIP must include risk-based 
procedures for verifying the identity of 
each customer to the extent reasonable 
and practicable. The procedures must 
enable the bank to form a reasonable 
belief that it knows the true identity of 
each customer. These procedures must 
be based on the bank&#x2019;s assessment of the 
relevant risks, including those presented 
by the various types of accounts 
maintained by the bank, the various 
methods of opening accounts provided 
by the bank, the various types of 
identifying information available, and 
the bank&#x2019;s size, location, and customer 
base. At a minimum, these procedures 
must contain the elements described in 
this paragraph (a)(2). 
<Node id="287289"/>(i) Customer information required&#x2014; 
(A) In general. The CIP must contain 
procedures for opening an account that 
specify the identifying information that 
will be obtained from each customer. 
Except as permitted by paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the 
bank must obtain, at a minimum, the 
following information from the 
customer prior to opening an account: 
<Node id="287669"/>(1) Name; 
(2) Date of birth, for an individual; 
(3) Address, which shall be: 
(i) For an individual, a residential or 
<Node id="287790"/>business street address; 
(ii) For an individual who does not 
<Node id="287853"/>have a residential or business street 
address, an Army Post Office (APO) or 
Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or 
the residential or business street address 
of next of kin or of another contact 
individual; or 
<Node id="288069"/>(iii) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), a principal place 
<Node id="288182"/>of business, local office, or other 
physical location; and 
<Node id="288243"/>(4) Identification number, which shall 
be: 
<Node id="288288"/>(i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer 
identification number; or 
<Node id="288350"/>(ii) For a non-U.S. person, one or more 
of the following: A taxpayer 
identification number; passport number 
and country of issuance; alien 
identification card number; or number 
and country of issuance of any other 
government-issued document 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard. 
<Node id="288684"/>Note to Paragraph(a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When 
opening an account for a foreign business or 
enterprise that does not have an 
identification number, the bank must request 
alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the 
business or enterprise. 
<Node id="288957"/>(B) Exception for persons applying for 
a taxpayer identification number. 
Instead of obtaining a taxpayer 
identification number from a customer 
prior to opening the account, the CIP 
may include procedures for opening an 
account for a customer that has applied 
for, but has not received, a taxpayer 
identification number. In this case, the 
CIP must include procedures to confirm 
that the application was filed before the 
customer opens the account and to 
obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of 
time after the account is opened. 
<Node id="289531"/>(C) Credit card accounts. In 
connection with a customer who opens 
a credit card account, a bank may obtain 
the identifying information about a 
customer required under paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(A) by acquiring it from a third- 
party source prior to extending credit to 
the customer. 
<Node id="289815"/>(ii) Customer verification. The CIP 
must contain procedures for verifying 
the identity of the customer, using 
information obtained in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, 
within a reasonable time after the 
account is opened. The procedures must 
describe when the bank will use 
documents, non-documentary methods, 
or a combination of both methods as 
described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). 
<Node id="290231"/>(A) Verification through documents. 
For a bank relying on documents, the 
CIP must contain procedures that set 
forth the documents that the bank will 
use. These documents may include: 
<Node id="290419"/>(1) For an individual, unexpired 
government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver&#x2019;s license or 
passport; and 
<Node id="290618"/>(2) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), documents 
showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of 
incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership 
agreement, or trust instrument. 
<Node id="290892"/>(B) Verification through non- 
documentary methods. For a bank 
relying on non-documentary methods, 
the CIP must contain procedures that 
describe the non-documentary methods 
the bank will use. 
<Node id="291089"/>(1) These methods may include 
contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer&#x2019;s identity 
through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with 
information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or 
other source; checking references with 
other financial institutions; and 
obtaining a financial statement. 
<Node id="291449"/>(2) The bank&#x2019;s non-documentary 
procedures must address situations 
where an individual is unable to present 
an unexpired government-issued 
identification document that bears a 
photograph or similar safeguard; the 
bank is not familiar with the documents 
presented; the account is opened 
without obtaining documents; the 
customer opens the account without 
appearing in person at the bank; and 
where the bank is otherwise presented 
with circumstances that increase the 
risk that the bank will be unable to 
verify the true identity of a customer 
through documents. 
<Node id="292025"/>(C) Additional verification for certain 
customers. The CIP must address 
situations where, based on the bank&#x2019;s 
risk assessment of a new account 
opened by a customer that is not an 
individual, the bank will obtain 
information about individuals with 
authority or control over such account, 
including signatories, in order to verify 
the customer&#x2019;s identity. This 
verification method applies only when 
the bank cannot verify the customer&#x2019;s 
true identity using the verification 
methods described in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. 
<Node id="292583"/>(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must 
include procedures for responding to 
circumstances in which the bank cannot 
form a reasonable belief that it knows 
the true identity of a customer. These 
procedures should describe: 
<Node id="292812"/>(A) When the bank should not open 
an account; 
<Node id="292860"/>(B) The terms under which a customer 
may use an account while the bank 
attempts to verify the customer&#x2019;s 
identity;

<Node id="293352"/>(D) When the bank should file a 
Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and

<Node id="293465"/>(3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must 
include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information 
obtained under the procedures 
implementing paragraph (a) of this 
section. 
<Node id="293651"/>(i) Required records. At a minimum, 
the record must include: 
<Node id="293714"/>(A) All identifying information about 
a customer obtained under paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; 
<Node id="293818"/>(B) A description of any document 
that was relied on under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the 
type of document, any identification 
number contained in the document, the 
place of issuance and, if any, the date 
of issuance and expiration date; 
<Node id="294083"/>(C) A description of the methods and 
the results of any measures undertaken 
to verify the identity of the customer 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of 
this section; and 
<Node id="294261"/>(D) A description of the resolution of 
any substantive discrepancy discovered 
when verifying the identifying 
information obtained. 
<Node id="294396"/>(ii) Retention of records. The bank 
must retain the information in 
paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for 
five years after the date the account is 
closed or, in the case of credit card 
accounts, five years after the account is 
closed or becomes dormant. The bank 
must retain the information in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of 
this section for five years after the 
record is made. 
<Node id="294800"/>(4) Comparison with government lists. 
The CIP must include procedures for 
determining whether the customer 
appears on any list of known or 
suspected terrorists or terrorist 
organizations issued by any Federal 
government agency and designated as 
such by Treasury in consultation with 
the Federal functional regulators. The 
procedures must require the bank to 
make such a determination within a 
reasonable period of time after the 
account is opened, or earlier, if required 
by another Federal law or regulation or 
Federal directive issued in connection 
with the applicable list. The procedures 
must also require the bank to follow all 
Federal directives issued in connection 
with such lists. 
<Node id="295509"/>(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must 
include procedures for providing bank 
customers with adequate notice that the 
bank is requesting information to verify 
their identities. 
<Node id="295688"/>(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is 
adequate if the bank generally describes 
the identification requirements of this 
section and provides the notice in a 
manner reasonably designed to ensure 
that a customer is able to view the 
notice, or is otherwise given notice, 
before opening an account. For example, 
depending upon the manner in which 
the account is opened, a bank may post 
a notice in the lobby or on its Web site, 
include the notice on its account 
applications, or use any other form of 
written or oral notice. 
<Node id="296216"/>(iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a 
bank may use the following sample 
language to provide notice to its 
customers: 
Important Information About Procedures for 
Opening a New Account 
<Node id="296405"/>To help the government fight the funding 
of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that 
identifies each person who opens an account. 
<Node id="296637"/>What this means for you: When you open 
an account, we will ask for your name, 
address, date of birth, and other information 
that will allow us to identify you. We may 
also ask to see your driver&#x2019;s license or other 
identifying documents. 
<Node id="296880"/>(6) Reliance on another financial 
institution. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when a bank will 
rely on the performance by another 
financial institution (including an 
affiliate) of any procedures of the bank&#x2019;s 
CIP, with respect to any customer of the 
bank that is opening, or has opened, an 
account or has established a similar 
formal banking or business relationship 
with the other financial institution to 
provide or engage in services, dealings, 
or other financial transactions, provided 
that: 
<Node id="297401"/>(i) Such reliance is reasonable under 
the circumstances; 
<Node id="297460"/>(ii) The other financial institution is 
subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. 
5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal 
functional regulator; and 
<Node id="297609"/>(iii) The other financial institution 
enters into a contract requiring it to 
certify annually to the bank that it has 
implemented its anti-money laundering 
program, and that it will perform (or its 
agent will perform) the specified 
requirements of the bank&#x2019;s CIP.<Node id="297878"/> 
<Node id="297880"/>(b) Exemptions. The appropriate 
Federal functional regulator, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary, may, by 
order or regulation, exempt any bank or 
type of account from the requirements 
of this section. The Federal functional 
regulator and the Secretary shall 
consider whether the exemption is 
consistent with the purposes of the 
Bank Secrecy Act and with safe and 
sound banking, and may consider other 
<Node id="298295"/>appropriate factors. The Secretary will 
make these determinations for any bank 
or type of account that is not subject to 
the authority of a Federal functional 
regulator.<Node id="298468"/> <Node id="298469"/>
<Node id="298470"/>(c) Other requirements unaffected. 
Nothing in this section relieves a bank 
of its obligation to comply with any 
other provision in this chapter,

persons&#x2014;(1) General. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, a bank must designate an 
exempt person by filing FinCEN Form 
110. Such designation must occur by the 
close of the 30-calendar day period 
beginning after the day of the first 
reportable transaction in currency with 
that person sought to be exempted from

if the requirements under this section 
are otherwise satisfied, a bank may 
designate a non-listed business or a 
payroll customer, as described in 
paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section, 
as an exempt person before the 
customer has maintained a transaction 
account at the bank for at least two 
months if the bank conducts and 
documents a risk-based assessment of 
the customer and forms a reasonable 
belief that the customer has a legitimate 
business purpose for conducting 
frequent transactions in currency. <Node id="305087"/>
<Node id="305088"/>(d) Annual review. At least once each 
year, a bank must review the eligibility 
of an exempt person described in 
paragraphs (b)(4) to (7) of this section to 
determine whether such person remains 
eligible for an exemption. As part of its 
annual review, a bank must review the 
application of the monitoring system 
required to be maintained by paragraph 
(h)(2) of this section to each existing 
account of an exempt person described 
in paragraphs (b)(6) or (b)(7) of this 
section. <Node id="305576"/>
<Node id="305577"/>(e) Operating rules&#x2014;(1) General rule. 
Subject to the specific rules of this 
<Node id="305655"/>section, a bank must take such steps to 
assure itself that a person is an exempt 
person (within the meaning of the 
applicable provision of paragraph (b) of 
this section), to document the basis for 
its conclusions, and document its 
compliance, with the terms of this 
section, that a reasonable and prudent 
bank would take and document to 
protect itself from loan or other fraud or 
loss based on misidentification of a 
person&#x2019;s status, and in the case of the 
monitoring system requirement set forth 
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, such 
steps that a reasonable and prudent 
bank would take and document to 
identify suspicious transactions as 
required by paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section. 
<Node id="306363"/>(2) Governmental departments and 
agencies. A bank may treat a person as 
a governmental department, agency, or 
entity if the name of such person 
reasonably indicates that it is described 
in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this 
section, or if such person is known 
generally in the community to be a 
State, the District of Columbia, a tribal 
government, a Territory or Insular 
Possession of the United States, or a 
political subdivision or a wholly-owned 
agency or instrumentality of any of the 
foregoing. An entity generally exercises 
governmental authority on behalf of the 
United States, a State, or a political 
subdivision, for purposes of paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, only if its 
authorities include one or more of the 
powers to tax, to exercise the authority 
of eminent domain, or to exercise police 
powers with respect to matters within 
its jurisdiction. Examples of entities that 
exercise governmental authority 
include, but are not limited to, the New 
Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
<Node id="307428"/>(3) Stock exchange listings. In 
determining whether a person is 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, a bank may rely on any New 
York, American, or NASDAQ Stock 
Market listing published in a newspaper 
of general circulation, on any commonly 
accepted or published stock symbol 
guide, on any information contained in 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission &#x2018;&#x2018;EDGAR&#x2019;&#x2019; System, or on 
any information contained on an

American Stock Exchange, or the 
NASDAQ.

Form 10&#x2013;K, as filed in each case with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
<Node id="308729"/>(5) Aggregated accounts. In 
determining the qualification of a 
customer as a non-listed business or a 
payroll customer, a bank may treat all 
exemptible accounts of the customer as 
a single account. If a bank elects to treat 
all exemptible accounts of a customer as 
a single account, the bank must 
continue to treat such accounts 
consistently as a single account for 
purposes of determining the 
qualification of the customer as a non- 
listed business or payroll customer. 
<Node id="309213"/>(6) Affiliated banks. The designation 
required by paragraph (c) of this section 
may be made by a parent bank holding 
company or one of its bank subsidiaries 
on behalf of all bank subsidiaries of the 
holding company, so long as the 
designation lists each bank subsidiary to 
which the designation shall apply. 
<Node id="309529"/>(7) Sole proprietorships. A sole 
proprietorship may be treated as a non- 
listed business if it otherwise meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, as applicable. In addition, a sole 
proprietorship may be treated as a 
payroll customer if it otherwise meets 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of 
this section, as applicable. 
<Node id="309881"/>(8) Ineligible businesses. A business 
engaged primarily in one or more of the 
following activities may not be treated 
as a non-listed business for purposes of 
this section: Serving as financial 
institutions or agents of financial 
institutions of any type; purchase or sale 
to customers of motor vehicles of any 
kind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment 
or mobile homes; the practice of law, 
accountancy, or medicine; auctioning of 
goods; chartering or operation of ships, 
buses, or aircraft; gaming of any kind 
(other than licensed parimutuel betting 
at race tracks); investment advisory 
services or investment banking services; 
real estate brokerage; pawn brokerage; 
title insurance and real estate closing; 
trade union activities; and any other 
activities that may be specified by 
FinCEN. A business that engages in 
multiple business activities may be 
treated as a non-listed business so long 
as no more than 50% of its gross 
revenues are derived from one or more 
of the ineligible business activities 
listed in this paragraph (e)(8). 
<Node id="310943"/>(9) Exemptible accounts of a non- 
listed business or payroll customer. The 
exemptible accounts of a non-listed 
<Node id="311057"/>business or payroll customer include 
transaction accounts and money market 
deposit accounts. However, money 
market deposit accounts maintained 
other than in connection with a 
commercial enterprise are not 
exemptible accounts. A transaction 
account, for purposes of this section, is 
any account described in section 
19(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act, 
12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(C), and its 
implementing regulations (12 CFR part 
204). A money market deposit account, 
for purposes of this section, is any 
interest-bearing account that is 
described as a money market deposit 
account in 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2). 
<Node id="311674"/>(10) Documentation. The records 
maintained by a bank to document its 
compliance with and administration of 
the rules of this section shall be 
maintained in accordance with the 
provisions of  1010.430. <Node id="311881"/>
<Node id="311882"/>(f) Limitation on exemption. A 
transaction carried out by an exempt 
person as an agent for another person 
who is the beneficial owner of the funds 
that are the subject of a transaction in 
currency is not subject to the exemption 
from reporting contained in paragraph 
(a) of this section. <Node id="312177"/>
<Node id="312178"/>(g) Limitation on liability. (1) No bank 
shall be subject to penalty under this 
chapter for failure to file a report 
required by  1010.311 with respect to a 
transaction in currency by an exempt 
person with respect to which the 
requirements of this section have been 
satisfied, unless the bank: 
<Node id="312481"/>(i) Knowingly files false or incomplete 
information with respect to the 
transaction or the customer engaging in 
the transaction; or 
<Node id="312617"/>(ii) Has reason to believe that the 
customer does not meet the criteria 
established by this section for treatment 
of the transactor as an exempt person or 
that the transaction is not a transaction 
of the exempt person. 
<Node id="312842"/>(2) Subject to the specific terms of this 
section, and absent any specific 
knowledge of information indicating 
that a customer no longer meets the 
requirements of an exempt person, a 
bank satisfies the requirements of this 
section to the extent it continues to treat 
that customer as an exempt person until 
the completion of that customer&#x2019;s next 
required periodic review, which as 
required by paragraph (d) of this section 
for an exempt person described in 
paragraph (b)(4) to (7) of this section, 
shall occur no less than once each year. 
<Node id="313395"/>(3) A bank that files a report with 
respect to a currency transaction by an 
exempt person rather than treating such 
person as exempt shall remain subject, 
with respect to each such report, to the 
rules for filing reports, and the penalties 
<Node id="313641"/>for filing false or incomplete reports that 
are applicable to reporting of 
transactions in currency by persons 
other than exempt persons. <Node id="313782"/>
<Node id="313783"/>(h) Obligations to file suspicious 
activity reports and maintain system for 
monitoring transactions in currency. (1) 
Nothing in this section relieves a bank 
of the obligation, or reduces in any way 
such bank&#x2019;s obligation, to file a report 
required by  1020.320 with respect to 
any transaction, including any 
transaction in currency that a bank 
knows, suspects, or has reason to 
suspect is a transaction or attempted 
transaction that is described in 
 1020.320(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii), or 
relieves a bank of any reporting or 
recordkeeping obligation imposed by 
this chapter (except the obligation to 
report transactions in currency pursuant 
to this chapter to the extent provided in 
this section). Thus, for example, a sharp 
increase from one year to the next in the 
gross total of currency transactions 
made by an exempt customer, or 
similarly anomalous transactions trends 
or patterns, may trigger the obligation of 
a bank under  1020.320. 
<Node id="314752"/>(2) Consistent with its annual review 
obligations under paragraph (d) of this 
section, a bank shall establish and 
maintain a monitoring system that is 
reasonably designed to detect, for each 
account of a non-listed business or 
payroll customer, those transactions in 
currency involving such account that 
would require a bank to file a suspicious 
transaction report. The statement in the 
preceding sentence with respect to 
accounts of non-listed business and 
payroll customers does not limit the 
obligation of banks generally to take the 
steps necessary to satisfy the terms of 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section and 
 1020.320 with respect to all exempt 
persons. <Node id="315430"/>
<Node id="315431"/>(i) Revocation. Without any action on 
the part of the Department of the 
Treasury and subject to the limitation 
on liability contained in paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section: 
<Node id="315607"/>(1) The status of an entity as an 
exempt person under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section ceases once such entity 
ceases to be listed on the applicable 
stock exchange; and 
<Node id="315781"/>(2) The status of a subsidiary as an 
exempt person under paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section ceases once such subsidiary 
ceases to have at least 51 per cent of its 
common stock or analogous equity 
interest owned by a listed entity.

message format. 
<Node id="316691"/> 1020.320 Reports by banks of suspicious 
transactions. 
<Node id="316749"/>(a) General. (1) Every bank shall file 
with the Treasury Department, to the 
extent and in the manner required by 
this section, a report of any suspicious 
transaction relevant to a possible 
violation of law or regulation. A bank 
may also file with the Treasury 
Department by using the Suspicious 
Activity Report specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section or otherwise, a 
report of any suspicious transaction that 
it believes is relevant to the possible 
violation of any law or regulation but 
whose reporting is not required by this 
section. 
<Node id="317307"/>(2) A transaction requires reporting 
under the terms of this section if it is 
conducted or attempted by, at, or 
through the bank, it involves or 
aggregates at least $5,000 in funds or 
other assets, and the bank knows, 
suspects, or has reason to suspect that: 
<Node id="317573"/>(i) The transaction involves funds 
derived from illegal activities or is 
intended or conducted in order to hide 
or disguise funds or assets derived from 
illegal activities (including, without 
limitation, the ownership, nature, 
source, location, or control of such 
funds or assets) as part of a plan to 
violate or evade any Federal law or 
regulation or to avoid any transaction 
reporting requirement under Federal 
law or regulation; 
<Node id="318017"/>(ii) The transaction is designed to 
evade any requirements of this chapter 
or of any other regulations promulgated 
under the Bank Secrecy Act; or 
<Node id="318167"/>(iii) The transaction has no business 
or apparent lawful purpose or is not the 
sort in which the particular customer 
would normally be expected to engage, 
and the bank knows of no reasonable 
explanation for the transaction after 
examining the available facts, including 
the background and possible purpose of 
the transaction. <Node id="318501"/>
<Node id="318502"/>(b) Filing procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. 
A suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report (&#x2018;&#x2018;SAR&#x2019;&#x2019;), and collecting 
and maintaining supporting 
documentation as required by paragraph 
(d) of this section. 
<Node id="318748"/>(2) Where to file. The SAR shall be 
filed with FinCEN in a central location, 
to be determined by FinCEN, as 
indicated in the instructions to the SAR. 
<Node id="318902"/>(3) When to file. A bank is required to 
file a SAR no later than 30 calendar 
days after the date of initial detection by 
the bank of facts that may constitute a 
basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was 
identified on the date of the detection of 
the incident requiring the filing, a bank 
may delay filing a SAR for an additional 
30 calendar days to identify a suspect. 
<Node id="319280"/>In no case shall reporting be delayed 
more than 60 calendar days after the 
date of initial detection of a reportable 
transaction. In situations involving 
violations that require immediate 
attention, such as, for example, ongoing 
money laundering schemes, the bank 
shall immediately notify, by telephone, 
an appropriate law enforcement 
authority in addition to filing timely a 
SAR. <Node id="319671"/>
<Node id="319672"/>(c) Exceptions. A bank is not required 
to file a SAR for a robbery or burglary 
committed or attempted that is reported 
to appropriate law enforcement 
authorities, or for lost, missing, 
counterfeit, or stolen securities with 
respect to which the bank files a report 
pursuant to the reporting requirements 
of 17 CFR 240.17f&#x2013;1. <Node id="320005"/>
<Node id="320006"/>(d) Retention of records. A bank shall 
maintain a copy of any SAR filed and 
the original or business record 
equivalent of any supporting 
documentation for a period of five years 
from the date of filing the SAR. 
Supporting documentation shall be 
identified, and maintained by the bank 
as such, and shall be deemed to have 
been filed with the SAR. A bank shall 
make all supporting documentation 
available to FinCEN and any 
appropriate law enforcement agencies or 
bank supervisory agencies upon request. <Node id="320520"/>
<Node id="320521"/>(e) Confidentiality of reports; 
limitation of liability. No bank or other 
financial institution, and no director, 
officer, employee, or agent of any bank 
or other financial institution, who 
reports a suspicious transaction under 
this chapter, may notify any person 
involved in the transaction that the 
transaction has been reported. Thus, any 
person subpoenaed or otherwise 
requested to disclose a SAR or the 
information contained in a SAR, except 
where such disclosure is requested by 
FinCEN or an appropriate law 
enforcement or bank supervisory 
agency, shall decline to produce the 
SAR or to provide any information that 
would disclose that a SAR has been 
prepared or filed, citing this paragraph 
(e) and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall 
notify FinCEN of any such request and 
its response thereto. A bank, and any 
director, officer, employee, or agent of 
such bank, that makes a report pursuant 
to this section (whether such report is 
required by this section or is made 
voluntarily) shall be protected from 
liability for any disclosure contained in, 
or for failure to disclose the fact of such 
report, or both, to the full extent 
provided by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3). <Node id="321717"/>
<Node id="321718"/>(f) Compliance. Compliance with this 
section shall be audited by the 
Department of the Treasury, through 
FinCEN or its delegees under the terms 
<Node id="321866"/>of the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to 
satisfy the requirements of this section 
may be a violation of the reporting rules 
of the Bank Secrecy Act and of this 
chapter. Such failure may also violate 
provisions of Title 12 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations. <Node id="322125"/>

order from an originator that is not an 
established customer, in addition to 
obtaining and retaining the information 
required in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section: 
<Node id="324484"/>(i) If the payment order is made in 
person, prior to acceptance the 
originator&#x2019;s bank shall verify the 
identity of the person placing the 
payment order. If it accepts the payment 
order, the originator&#x2019;s bank shall obtain 
and retain a record of the name and 
address, the type of identification 
reviewed, the number of the 
identification document (e.g., driver&#x2019;s

(e.g., social security or employer 
identification number) or, if none, alien 
identification number or passport 
number and country of issuance, or a 
notation in the record of the lack 
thereof. If the originator&#x2019;s bank has 
knowledge that the person placing the 
payment order is not the originator, the 
originator&#x2019;s bank shall obtain and retain 
a record of the originator&#x2019;s taxpayer 
identification number (e.g., social 
security or employer identification 
number) or, if none, alien identification 
number or passport number and country 
of issuance, if known by the person 
placing the order, or a notation in the 
record of the lack thereof. 
<Node id="325587"/>(ii) If the payment order accepted by 
the originator&#x2019;s bank is not made in 
person, the originator&#x2019;s bank shall 
obtain and retain a record of name and 
address of the person placing the

method of payment (e.g., check or credit 
card transaction) for the funds transfer. 
If the originator&#x2019;s bank has knowledge 
that the person placing the payment 
order is not the originator, the 
originator&#x2019;s bank shall obtain and retain 
a record of the originator&#x2019;s taxpayer 
identification number (e.g., social 
security or employer identification 
number) or, if none, alien identification

<Node id="326757"/>is not an established customer, in 
addition to obtaining and retaining the 
information required in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section: 
<Node id="326899"/>(i) If the proceeds are delivered in 
person to the beneficiary or its 
representative or agent, the beneficiary&#x2019;s 
bank shall verify the identity of the 
person receiving the proceeds and shall 
obtain and retain a record of the name 
and address, the type of identification 
reviewed, and the number of the 
identification document (e.g., driver&#x2019;s 
license), as well as a record of the 
person&#x2019;s taxpayer identification number 
(e.g., social security or employer 
identification number) or, if none, alien 
identification number or passport 
number and country of issuance, or a 
notation in the record of the lack 
thereof. If the beneficiary&#x2019;s bank has 
knowledge that the person receiving the 
proceeds is not the beneficiary, the 
beneficiary&#x2019;s bank shall obtain and 
retain a record of the beneficiary&#x2019;s name 
and address, as well as the beneficiary&#x2019;s 
taxpayer identification number (e.g., 
social security or employer 
identification number) or, if none, alien 
identification number or passport 
number and country of issuance, if 
known by the person receiving the 
proceeds, or a notation in the record of 
the lack thereof. 
<Node id="328037"/>(ii) If the proceeds are delivered other 
than in person, the beneficiary&#x2019;s bank 
shall retain a copy of the check or other 
instrument used to effect payment, or 
the information contained thereon, as 
well as the name and address of the 
person to which it was sent. 
<Node id="328307"/>(4) Retrievability. The information 
that an originator&#x2019;s bank must retain 
under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of 
this section shall be retrievable by the 
originator&#x2019;s bank by reference to the 
name of the originator. If the originator 
is an established customer of the 
originator&#x2019;s bank and has an account 
used for funds transfers, then the 
information also shall be retrievable by 
account number. The information that a 
beneficiary&#x2019;s bank must retain under 
paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(3) of this 
section shall be retrievable by the 
beneficiary&#x2019;s bank by reference to the 
name of the beneficiary. If the 
beneficiary is an established customer of 
the beneficiary&#x2019;s bank and has an 
account used for funds transfers, then 
the information also shall be retrievable 
by account number. This information 
need not be retained in any particular 
manner, so long as the bank is able to 
retrieve the information required by this 
paragraph, either by accessing funds 
transfer records directly or through 
reference to some other record 
maintained by the bank. 
<Node id="329385"/>(5) Verification. Where verification is 
required under paragraphs (a)(2) and 
(a)(3) of this section, a bank shall verify 
a person&#x2019;s identity by examination of a 
document (other than a bank signature 
card), preferably one that contains the 
person&#x2019;s name, address, and 
photograph, that is normally acceptable 
by financial institutions as a means of 
identification when cashing checks for 
persons other than established 
customers. Verification of the identity of 
an individual who indicates that he or 
she is an alien or is not a resident of the 
United States may be made by passport, 
alien identification card, or other 
official document evidencing 
nationality or residence (e.g., a foreign 
driver&#x2019;s license with indication of home 
address). 
<Node id="330145"/>(6) Exceptions. The following funds 
transfers are not subject to the 
requirements of this section: 
<Node id="330247"/>(i) Funds transfers where the 
originator and beneficiary are any of the 
following:

<Node id="330935"/>originator and the beneficiary are the 
same person and the originator&#x2019;s bank 
and the beneficiary&#x2019;s bank are the same 
bank. <Node id="331061"/>
<Node id="331062"/>(b)(1) With respect to each certificate 
of deposit sold or redeemed after May 
31, 1978, and before October 1, 2003, or

<Node id="354572"/>(b) Filing procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. 
A suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report by Casinos (&#x2018;&#x2018;SARC&#x2019;&#x2019;), 
and collecting and maintaining 
supporting documentation as required 
by paragraph (d) of this section. 
<Node id="354830"/>(2) Where to file. The SARC shall be 
filed with FinCEN in a central location, 
to be determined by FinCEN, as 
indicated in the instructions to the 
SARC. 
<Node id="354987"/>(3) When to file. A SARC shall be filed 
no later than 30 calendar days after the 
date of the initial detection by the 
casino of facts that may constitute a 
basis for filing a SARC under this 
section. If no suspect is identified on the 
date of such initial detection, a casino 
may delay filing a SARC for an 
additional 30 calendar days to identify 
a suspect, but in no case shall reporting 
be delayed more than 60 calendar days 
after the date of such initial detection. 
In situations involving violations that 
require immediate attention, such as 
ongoing money laundering schemes, the 
casino shall immediately notify by 
telephone an appropriate law 
enforcement authority in addition to 
filing timely a SARC. Casinos wishing 
voluntarily to report suspicious 
transactions that may relate to terrorist 
activity may call FinCEN&#x2019;s Financial 
Institutions Hotline at 1&#x2013;866&#x2013;556&#x2013;3974 
in addition to filing timely a SARC if 
required by this section. <Node id="355950"/>
<Node id="355951"/>(c) Exceptions. A casino is not 
required to file a SARC for a robbery or 
burglary committed or attempted that is 
reported to appropriate law enforcement 
authorities. <Node id="356121"/>
<Node id="356122"/>(d) Retention of records. A casino 
shall maintain a copy of any SARC filed 
and the original or business record 
equivalent of any supporting 
documentation for a period of five years 
from the date of filing the SARC. 
Supporting documentation shall be 
identified as such and maintained by 
the casino, and shall be deemed to have 
been filed with the SARC. A casino 
shall make all supporting 
documentation available to FinCEN, any 
other appropriate law enforcement 
agencies or Federal, State, local, or tribal 
gaming regulators upon request. <Node id="356673"/>
<Node id="356674"/>(e) Confidentiality of reports; 
limitation of liability. No casino, and no 
director, officer, employee, or agent of 
any casino, who reports a suspicious 
transaction under this chapter, may 
notify any person involved in the 
transaction that the transaction has been 
reported. Thus, any person subpoenaed 
or otherwise requested to disclose a 
SARC or the information contained in a 
SARC, except where such disclosure is 
requested by FinCEN or another 
appropriate law enforcement or 
regulatory agency, shall decline to 
produce the SARC or to provide any 
information that would disclose that a 
SARC has been prepared or filed, citing 
this paragraph (e) and 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)(2), and shall notify FinCEN of 
any such request and its response 
thereto. A casino, and any director, 
officer, employee, or agent of such 
casino, that makes a report pursuant to 
this section (whether such report is 
required by this section or made 
voluntarily) shall be protected from 
liability for any disclosure contained in, 
or for failure to disclose the fact of, such 
report, or both, to the extent provided 
by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3). <Node id="357811"/>
<Node id="357812"/>(f) Compliance. Compliance with this 
section shall be audited by the 
Department of the Treasury, through 
FinCEN or its delegees, under the terms 
of the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to 
satisfy the requirements of this section 
may constitute a violation of the 
reporting rules of the Bank Secrecy Act 
and of this chapter.<Node id="358136"/> 
<Node id="358138"/>(g) Applicability date. This section 
applies to transactions occurring after 
March 25, 2003. <Node id="358233"/>
<Node id="358234"/> 1021.330 Exceptions to the reporting 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5331. 
<Node id="358307"/>(a) Receipt of currency by certain 
casinos having gross annual gaming 
revenue in excess of $1,000,000&#x2014;In 
general. If a casino receives currency in 
excess of $10,000 and is required to 
report the receipt of such currency 
directly to the Treasury Department 
under  1010.306,  1021.311, or 
 1021.313 and is subject to the 
<Node id="358638"/>recordkeeping requirements of 
 1021.410, then the casino is not 
required to make a report with respect 
to the receipt of such currency under 31 
U.S.C. 5331 and this section. 
<Node id="358818"/>(b) Casinos exempt under 
 1010.970(c). Pursuant to  1010.970, 
the Secretary may exempt from the 
reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements under  1010.306, 
 1021.311,  1021.313 or  1021.410 
casinos in any state whose regulatory 
system substantially meets the reporting 
and recordkeeping requirements of this 
chapter. Such casinos shall not be 
required to report receipt of currency 
under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section. 
<Node id="359255"/>(c) Reporting of currency received in 
a non-gaming business. Non-gaming 
businesses (such as shops, restaurants, 
entertainment, and hotels) at casino 
hotels and resorts are separate trades or 
businesses in which the receipt of 
currency in excess of $10,000 is 
reportable under section 5331 and these 
regulations. Thus, a casino exempt 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
must report with respect to currency in 
excess of $10,000 received in its non- 
gaming businesses. <Node id="359742"/>
<Node id="359743"/>(d) Example. The following example 
illustrates the application of the rules in 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section: 
<Node id="359865"/>Example. A and B are casinos having gross 
annual gaming revenue in excess of 
$1,000,000. C is a casino with gross annual 
gaming revenue of less than $1,000,000. 
Casino A receives $15,000 in currency from 
a customer with respect to a gaming 
transaction which the casino reports to the 
Treasury Department under  1010.306, 
1021.311, and 1021.313. Casino B receives 
$15,000 in currency from a customer in 
payment for accommodations provided to 
that customer at Casino B&#x2019;s hotel. Casino C 
receives $15,000 in currency from a customer 
with respect to a gaming transaction. Casino 
A is not required to report the transaction 
under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or this section because 
the exception for certain casinos provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section (&#x2018;&#x2018;the casino 
exception&#x2019;&#x2019;) applies. Casino B is required to 
report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section 
because the casino exception does not apply 
to the receipt of currency from a nongaming 
activity. Casino C is required to report under 
31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section because the 
casino exception does not apply to casinos 
having gross annual gaming revenue of 
$1,000,000 or less which do not have to 
report to the Treasury Department under 
 1010.306, 1021.311, and 1021.313. <Node id="361117"/>

examination of a document of the type 
described in  1010.312 of this Chapter, 
and the specific identifying information 
shall be recorded in the manner 
described in  1010.312 of this Chapter. 
In the event that a casino has been 
unable to secure the required social 
security number, it shall not be deemed 
to be in violation of this section if it has 
made a reasonable effort to secure such 
number and it maintains a list 
containing the names and permanent 
addresses of those persons from who it 
has been unable to obtain social security 
numbers and makes the names and 
addresses of those persons available to

and cross referenced in this subpart. 
Money services businesses should also 
refer to Subpart B of Part 1010 of this 
Chapter for program requirements 
contained in that subpart which apply 
to money services businesses. <Node id="373292"/>
<Node id="373293"/> 1022.210 Anti-money laundering 
programs for money services businesses. 
<Node id="373368"/>(a) Each money services business, as 
defined by  1010.100(ff) of this 
Chapter, shall develop, implement, and 
maintain an effective anti-money 
laundering program. An effective anti- 
money laundering program is one that is 
reasonably designed to prevent the 
money services business from being 
used to facilitate money laundering and 
the financing of terrorist activities. 
<Node id="373749"/>(b) The program shall be 
commensurate with the risks posed by 
the location and size of, and the nature 
and volume of the financial services 
provided by, the money services 
business. 
<Node id="373937"/>(c) The program shall be in writing, 
and a money services business shall 
make copies of the anti-money 
laundering program available for 
inspection to the Department of the 
Treasury upon request. 
<Node id="374138"/>(d) At a minimum, the program shall: 
(1) Incorporate policies, procedures, 
<Node id="374215"/>and internal controls reasonably 
designed to assure compliance with this 
chapter. 
<Node id="374300"/>(i) Policies, procedures, and internal 
controls developed and implemented 
under this section shall include 
provisions for complying with the 
requirements of this chapter including, 
to the extent applicable to the money 
services business, requirements for: 
<Node id="374563"/>(A) Verifying customer identification; 
(B) Filing reports; 
(C) Creating and retaining records; 
<Node id="374661"/>and 
(D) Responding to law enforcement 
<Node id="374701"/>requests. 
(ii) Money services businesses that 
<Node id="374749"/>have automated data processing systems 
should integrate their compliance 
procedures with such systems. 
<Node id="374855"/>(iii) A person that is a money services 
business solely because it is an agent for 
another money services business as set 
forth in  1022.380(a)(2), and the money 
services business for which it serves as 
agent, may by agreement allocate 
between them responsibility for 
development of policies, procedures, 
and internal controls required by this 
paragraph (d)(1). Each money services 
business shall remain solely responsible 
for implementation of the requirements 
set forth in this section, and nothing in 
this paragraph (d)(1) relieves any money 
services business from its obligation to 
establish and maintain an effective anti- 
money laundering program. 
<Node id="375527"/>(2) Designate a person to assure day 
to day compliance with the program and

<Node id="378862"/> 1022.320 Reports by money services 
businesses of suspicious transactions. 
<Node id="378940"/>(a) General. (1) Every money services 
business, described in  1010.100(ff) (1), 
(3), (4), (5), or (6) of this Chapter, shall 
file with the Treasury Department, to 
the extent and in the manner required 
by this section, a report of any 
suspicious transaction relevant to a 
possible violation of law or regulation. 
Any money services business may also 
file with the Treasury Department, by 
using the form specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, or otherwise, a 
report of any suspicious transaction that 
it believes is relevant to the possible 
violation of any law or regulation but 
whose reporting is not required by this 
section. 
<Node id="379593"/>(2) A transaction requires reporting 
under the terms of this section if it is 
conducted or attempted by, at, or 
through a money services business, 
involves or aggregates funds or other 
assets of at least $2,000 (except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section), and the money services 
business knows, suspects, or has reason 
to suspect that the transaction (or a 
pattern of transactions of which the 
transaction is a part): 
<Node id="380036"/>(i) Involves funds derived from illegal 
activity or is intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activity (including, 
without limitation, the ownership, 
nature, source, location, or control of 
such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any Federal law or 
regulation or to avoid any transaction 
reporting requirement under Federal 
law or regulation; 
<Node id="380459"/>(ii) Is designed, whether through 
structuring or other means, to evade any 
requirements of this chapter or of any 
other regulations promulgated under the 
Bank Secrecy Act; or 
<Node id="380639"/>(iii) Serves no business or apparent 
lawful purpose, and the reporting 
money services business knows of no 
reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available 
facts, including the background and 
possible purpose of the transaction. 
<Node id="380899"/>(iv) Involves use of the money 
services business to facilitate criminal 
activity. 
<Node id="380984"/>(3) To the extent that the 
identification of transactions required to 
be reported is derived from a review of 
clearance records or other similar 
records of money orders or traveler&#x2019;s 
checks that have been sold or processed, 
an issuer of money orders or traveler&#x2019;s 
checks shall only be required to report 
a transaction or pattern of transactions 
that involves or aggregates funds or 
other assets of at least $5,000. 
<Node id="381410"/>(4) The obligation to identify and 
properly and timely to report a 
suspicious transaction rests with each 
money services business involved in the 
transaction, provided that no more than 
one report is required to be filed by the 
money services businesses involved in a 
particular transaction (so long as the 
report filed contains all relevant facts). 
Whether, in addition to any liability on 
its own for failure to report, a money 
services business that issues the 
instrument or provides the funds 
transfer service involved in the 
transaction may be liable for the failure 
of another money services business 
involved in the transaction to report that 
transaction depends upon the nature of 
the contractual or other relationship 
between the businesses, and the legal 
effect of the facts and circumstances of 
the relationship and transaction 
involved, under general principles of 
the law of agency. <Node id="382329"/>
<Node id="382330"/>(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of 
this section, a transaction that involves 
solely the issuance, or facilitation of the 
transfer of stored value, or the issuance, 
sale, or redemption of stored value, 
shall not be subject to reporting under 
this paragraph (a), until the 
promulgation of rules specifically 
relating to such reporting. <Node id="382675"/>
<Node id="382676"/>(b) Filing procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. 
A suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report-MSB (&#x2018;&#x2018;SAR&#x2013;MSB&#x2019;&#x2019;), and 
collecting and maintaining supporting

<Node id="383496"/>the initial detection by the money 
services business of facts that may 
constitute a basis for filing a SAR&#x2013;MSB 
under this section. In situations 
involving violations that require 
immediate attention, such as ongoing 
money laundering schemes, the money 
services business shall immediately 
notify by telephone an appropriate law 
enforcement authority in addition to 
filing a SAR&#x2013;MSB. Money services 
businesses wishing voluntarily to report 
suspicious transactions that may relate 
to terrorist activity may call FinCEN&#x2019;s 
Financial Institutions Hotline at 1&#x2013;866&#x2013; 
556&#x2013;3974 in addition to filing timely a 
SAR&#x2013;MSB if required by this section. <Node id="384148"/>
<Node id="384149"/>(c) Retention of records. A money 
services business shall maintain a copy 
of any SAR&#x2013;MSB filed and the original 
or business record equivalent of any 
supporting documentation for a period 
of five years from the date of filing the 
SAR&#x2013;MSB. Supporting documentation 
shall be identified as such and 
maintained by the money services 
business, and shall be deemed to have 
been filed with the SAR&#x2013;MSB. A money 
services business shall make all 
supporting documentation available to 
FinCEN and any other appropriate law 
enforcement agencies or supervisory 
agencies upon request. <Node id="384734"/>
<Node id="384735"/>(d) Confidentiality of reports; 
limitation of liability. No financial 
institution, and no director, officer, 
employee, or agent of any financial 
institution, who reports a suspicious 
transaction under this chapter, may 
notify any person involved in the 
transaction that the transaction has been 
reported. Thus, any person subpoenaed 
or otherwise requested to disclose a 
SAR&#x2013;MSB or the information contained 
in a SAR&#x2013;MSB, except where such 
disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an 
appropriate law enforcement or 
supervisory agency, shall decline to 
produce the SAR&#x2013;MSB or to provide 
any information that would disclose 
that a SAR&#x2013;MSB has been prepared or 
filed, citing this paragraph (d) and 31 
U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall notify 
FinCEN of any such request and its 
response thereto. A reporting money 
services business, and any director, 
officer, employee, or agent of such 
reporting money services business, that 
makes a report pursuant to this section 
(whether such report is required by this 
section or made voluntarily) shall be 
protected from liability for any 
disclosure contained in, or for failure to 
disclose the fact of, such report, or both, 
to the extent provided by 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)(3). <Node id="385967"/>
<Node id="385968"/>(e) Compliance. Compliance with this 
section shall be audited by the 
Department of the Treasury, through 
<Node id="386076"/>FinCEN or its delegees under the terms 
of the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to 
satisfy the requirements of this section 
may constitute a violation of the 
reporting rules of the Bank Secrecy Act 
and of this chapter.<Node id="386291"/> 
<Node id="386293"/>(f) Applicability date. This section 
applies to transactions occurring after 
December 31, 2001. <Node id="386391"/>
<Node id="386392"/> 1022.380 Registration of money services 
businesses. 
<Node id="386448"/>(a) Registration requirement&#x2014;(1) In 
general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, relating 
to agents, each money services business 
(whether or not licensed as a money 
services business by any State) must 
register with the Department of the 
Treasury and, as part of that registration, 
maintain a list of its agents as required 
by 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. This 
section does not apply to the U.S. Postal 
Service, to agencies of the United States, 
of any State, or of any political 
subdivision of a State, or to a person to 
the extent that the person is an issuer, 
seller, or redeemer of stored value. 
<Node id="387089"/>(2) Agents. A person that is a money 
services business solely because that 
person serves as an agent of another 
money services business, see 
 1010.100(ff) of this Chapter, is not 
required to register under this section, 
but a money services business that 
engages in activities described in 
 1010.100(ff) of this Chapter both on its 
own behalf and as an agent for others 
must register under this section. For 
example, a supermarket corporation that 
acts as an agent for an issuer of money 
orders and performs no other services of 
a nature and value that would cause the 
corporation to be a money services 
business, is not required to register; the 
answer would be the same if the 
supermarket corporation served as an 
agent both of a money order issuer and 
of a money transmitter. However, 
registration would be required if the 
supermarket corporation, in addition to 
acting as an agent of an issuer of money 
orders, cashed checks or exchanged 
currencies (other than as an agent for 
another business) in an amount greater 
than $1,000 in currency or monetary or 
other instruments for any person on any 
day, in one or more transactions. 
<Node id="388254"/>(3) Agency status. The determination 
whether a person is an agent depends 
on all the facts and circumstances. <Node id="388366"/>
<Node id="388367"/>(b) Registration procedures&#x2014;(1) In 
general. (i) A money services business 
must be registered by filing such form 
as FinCEN may specify with the 
Enterprise Computing Center in Detroit 
of the Internal Revenue Service (or such 
other location as the form may specify). 
The information required by 31 U.S.C. 
<Node id="388678"/>5330(b) and any other information 
required by the form must be reported 
in the manner and to the extent required 
by the form. 
<Node id="388808"/>(ii) A branch office of a money 
services business is not required to file 
its own registration form. A money 
services business must, however, report 
information about its branch locations 
or offices as provided by the 
instructions to the registration form. 
<Node id="389072"/>(iii) A money services business must 
retain a copy of any registration form 
filed under this section and any 
registration number that may be 
assigned to the business at a location in 
the United States and for the period 
specified in  1010.430(d) of this 
Chapter. 
<Node id="389344"/>(2) Registration period. A money 
services business must be registered for 
the initial registration period and each 
renewal period. The initial registration 
period is the two-calendar-year period 
beginning with the calendar year in 
which the money services business is 
first required to be registered. However, 
the initial registration period for a 
money services business required to 
register by December 31, 2001 (see 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is the 
two-calendar year period beginning 
2002. Each two-calendar-year period 
following the initial registration period 
is a renewal period. 
<Node id="389954"/>(3) Due date. The registration form for 
the initial registration period must be 
filed on or before the later of December 
31, 2001, and the end of the 180-day 
period beginning on the day following 
the date the business is established. The 
registration form for a renewal period 
must be filed on or before the last day 
of the calendar year preceding the 
renewal period. 
<Node id="390332"/>(4) Events requiring re-registration. If 
a money services business registered as 
such under the laws of any State 
experiences a change in ownership or 
control that requires the business to be 
re-registered under State law, the money 
services business must also be re- 
registered under this section. In 
addition, if there is a transfer of more 
than 10 percent of the voting power or 
equity interests of a money services 
business (other than a money services 
business that must report such transfer 
to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission), the money services 
business must be re-registered under 
this section. Finally, if a money services 
business experiences a more than 50-per 
cent increase in the number of its agents 
during any registration period, the 
money services business must be re- 
registered under this section. The 
registration form must be filed not later 
than 180 days after such change in

The calendar year in which the change, 
transfer, or increase occurs is treated as 
the first year of a new two-year 
registration period. 
<Node id="391747"/>(c) Persons required to file the 
registration form. Under 31 U.S.C. 
5330(a), any person who owns or 
controls a money services business is 
responsible for registering the business; 
however, only one registration form is 
required to be filed for each registration 
period. A person is treated as owning or 
controlling a money services business 
for purposes of filing the registration 
form only to the extent provided by the 
form. If more than one person owns or 
controls a money services business, the 
owning or controlling persons may enter 
into an agreement designating one of 
them to register the business. The 
failure of the designated person to 
register the money services business 
does not, however, relieve any of the 
other persons who own or control the 
business of liability for the failure to 
register the business. See paragraph (e) 
of this section, relating to consequences 
of the failure to comply with 31 U.S.C. 
5330 or this section. <Node id="392716"/>
<Node id="392717"/>(d) List of agents&#x2014;(1) In general. A 
money services business must prepare 
and maintain a list of its agents. The 
initial list of agents must be prepared by 
January 1, 2002, and must be revised 
each January 1, for the immediately 
preceding 12 month period; for money 
services businesses established after 
December 31, 2001, the initial agent list 
must be prepared by the due date of the 
initial registration form and must be 
revised each January 1 for the 
immediately preceding 12-month 
period. The list is not filed with the 
registration form but must be 
maintained at the location in the United 
States reported on the registration form 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
Upon request, a money services 
business must make its list of agents 
available to FinCEN and any other 
appropriate law enforcement agency 
(including, without limitation, the 
examination function of the Internal 
Revenue Service in its capacity as 
delegee of Bank Secrecy Act 
examination authority). Requests for 
information made pursuant to the 
preceding sentence shall be coordinated 
through FinCEN in the manner and to 
the extent determined by FinCEN. The

list must be retained for the period 
specified in  1010.430(d) of this 
Chapter.

(money orders, traveler&#x2019;s checks, check 
sales, check cashing, currency exchange, 
and money transmitting) the agent 
provides; 
<Node id="394663"/>(E) A listing of the months in the 12 
months immediately preceding the date 
of the most recent agent list in which 
the gross transaction amount of the 
agent with respect to financial products 
or services issued by the money services 
business maintaining the agent list 
exceeded $100,000. For this purpose, 
the money services gross transaction 
amount is the agent&#x2019;s gross amount 
(excluding fees and commissions) 
received from transactions of one or 
more businesses described in 
 1010.100(ff) of this Chapter; 
<Node id="395186"/>(F) The name and address of any 
depository institution at which the

(as defined in 12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(C)) for 
all or part of the funds received in or for 
the financial products or services issued 
by the money services business 
maintaining the list, whether in the 
agent&#x2019;s or the business principal&#x2019;s name;

became an agent of the money services

paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of 
this section is not required to be 
included in an agent list with respect to 
any person that is an agent of the money 
services business maintaining the list 
before the first day of the month 
beginning after February 16, 2000 so 
long as the information described by 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of 
this section is made available upon the 
request of FinCEN and any other 
appropriate law enforcement agency 
(including, without limitation, the 
examination function of the Internal 
Revenue Service in its capacity as 
delegee of Bank Secrecy Act 
examination authority). <Node id="396476"/>
<Node id="396477"/>(e) Consequences of failing to comply 
with 31 U.S.C. 5330 or the regulations 
<Node id="396556"/>thereunder. It is unlawful to do business 
without complying with 31 U.S.C. 5330

with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5330

liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for 
each violation. Each day a violation of 
31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section continues 
constitutes a separate violation. In 
addition, under 31 U.S.C. 5320, the 
Secretary of the Treasury may bring a 
civil action to enjoin the violation. See 
18 U.S.C. 1960 for a criminal penalty for 
failure to comply with the registration 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this 
section. <Node id="397383"/>

document, and maintain a written 
Customer Identification Program (&#x2018;&#x2018;CIP&#x2019;&#x2019;) 
appropriate for its size and business 
that, at a minimum, includes each of the 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(5) of this section. The CIP 
must be a part of the broker-dealer&#x2019;s 
anti-money laundering compliance 
program required under 31 U.S.C. 
5318(h). 
<Node id="411584"/>(2) Identity verification procedures. 
The CIP must include risk-based 
procedures for verifying the identity of 
each customer to the extent reasonable 
and practicable. The procedures must 
enable the broker-dealer to form a 
reasonable belief that it knows the true 
identity of each customer. The 
procedures must be based on the broker- 
dealer&#x2019;s assessment of the relevant risks, 
including those presented by the 
various types of accounts maintained by 
the broker-dealer, the various methods 
of opening accounts provided by the 
broker-dealer, the various types of 
identifying information available and 
the broker-dealer&#x2019;s size, location and 
customer base. At a minimum, these 
procedures must contain the elements 
described in this paragraph (a)(2). 
<Node id="412350"/>(i)(A) Customer information required. 
The CIP must contain procedures for 
opening an account that specify 
identifying information that will be 
obtained from each customer. Except as 
permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of 
this section, the broker-dealer must 
obtain, at a minimum, the following 
information prior to opening an 
account: 
<Node id="412695"/>(1) Name; 
(2) Date of birth, for an individual; 
(3) Address, which shall be: 
(i) For an individual, a residential or 
<Node id="412816"/>business street address; 
(ii) for an individual who does not 
<Node id="412879"/>have a residential or business street 
address, an Army Post Office (APO) or 
Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or

<Node id="413260"/>the residential or business street address 
of a next of kin or another contact 
individual; or 
<Node id="413357"/>(iii) for a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), a principal place 
of business, local office or other 
physical location; and 
<Node id="413529"/>(4) Identification number, which shall 
be: 
<Node id="413574"/>(i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer 
identification number; or 
<Node id="413636"/>(ii) for a non-U.S. person, one or more 
of the following: A taxpayer 
identification number, a passport 
number and country of issuance, an 
alien identification card number, or the 
number and country of issuance of any 
other government-issued document 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard. 
<Node id="413979"/>Note to Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When 
opening an account for a foreign business or 
enterprise that does not have an 
identification number, the broker-dealer must 
request alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the 
business or enterprise. 
<Node id="414262"/>(B) Exception for persons applying for 
a taxpayer identification number. 
Instead of obtaining a taxpayer 
identification number from a customer 
prior to opening an account, the CIP 
may include procedures for opening an 
account for a customer that has applied 
for, but has not received, a taxpayer 
identification number. In this case, the 
CIP must include procedures to confirm 
that the application was filed before the 
customer opens the account and to 
obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of 
time after the account is opened. 
<Node id="414835"/>(ii) Customer verification. The CIP 
must contain procedures for verifying 
the identity of each customer, using 
information obtained in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, 
within a reasonable time before or after 
the customer&#x2019;s account is opened. The 
procedures must describe when the 
broker-dealer will use documents, non- 
documentary methods, or a combination 
of both methods, as described in this 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii). 
<Node id="415285"/>(A) Verification through documents. 
For a broker-dealer relying on 
documents, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the documents 
the broker-dealer will use. These 
documents may include: 
<Node id="415487"/>(1) For an individual, an unexpired 
government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver&#x2019;s license or 
passport; and 
<Node id="415689"/>(2) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), documents 
showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of 
incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership 
agreement, or a trust instrument. 
<Node id="415964"/>(B) Verification through non- 
documentary methods. For a broker- 
dealer relying on non-documentary 
methods, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the non- 
documentary methods the broker-dealer 
will use. 
<Node id="416183"/>(1) These methods may include 
contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer&#x2019;s identity 
through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with 
information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or 
other source; checking references with 
other financial institutions; or obtaining 
a financial statement. 
<Node id="416542"/>(2) The broker-dealer&#x2019;s non- 
documentary procedures must address 
situations where an individual is unable 
to present an unexpired government- 
issued identification document that 
bears a photograph or similar safeguard; 
the broker-dealer is not familiar with the 
documents presented; the account is 
opened without obtaining documents; 
the customer opens the account without 
appearing in person at the broker-dealer; 
and where the broker-dealer is 
otherwise presented with circumstances 
that increase the risk that the broker- 
dealer will be unable to verify the true 
identity of a customer through 
documents. 
<Node id="417167"/>(C) Additional verification for certain 
customers. The CIP must address 
situations where, based on the broker- 
dealer&#x2019;s risk assessment of a new 
account opened by a customer that is 
not an individual, the broker-dealer will 
obtain information about individuals 
with authority or control over such 
account. This verification method 
applies only when the broker-dealer 
cannot verify the customer&#x2019;s true 
identity using the verification methods 
described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and 
(B) of this section. 
<Node id="417685"/>(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must 
include procedures for responding to 
circumstances in which the broker- 
dealer cannot form a reasonable belief 
that it knows the true identity of a 
customer. These procedures should 
describe: 
<Node id="417925"/>(A) When the broker-dealer should 
not open an account; 
<Node id="417982"/>(B) The terms under which a customer 
may conduct transactions while the 
broker-dealer attempts to verify the 
customer&#x2019;s identity; 
<Node id="418116"/>(C) When the broker-dealer should 
close an account after attempts to verify 
a customer&#x2019;s identity fail; and 
<Node id="418227"/>(D) When the broker-dealer should 
file a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulation. 
<Node id="418349"/>(3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must 
include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information 
obtained under procedures 
implementing paragraph (a) of this 
section. 
<Node id="418531"/>(i) Required records. At a minimum, 
the record must include: 
<Node id="418594"/>(A) All identifying information about 
a customer obtained under paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section, 
<Node id="418698"/>(B) A description of any document 
that was relied on under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the 
type of document, any identification 
number contained in the document, the 
place of issuance, and if any, the date 
of issuance and expiration date; 
<Node id="418963"/>(C) A description of the methods and 
the results of any measures undertaken 
to verify the identity of a customer 
under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of 
this section; and 
<Node id="419141"/>(D) A description of the resolution of 
each substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the 
identifying information obtained. 
<Node id="419277"/>(ii) Retention of records. The broker- 
dealer must retain the records made 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section for five years after the account 
is closed and the records made under 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C) and (D) of 
this section for five years after the 
record is made. In all other respects, the 
records must be maintained pursuant to 
the provisions of 17 CFR 240.17a&#x2013;4. 
<Node id="419673"/>(4) Comparison with government lists. 
The CIP must include procedures for 
determining whether a customer 
appears on any list of known or 
suspected terrorists or terrorist 
organizations issued by any Federal 
government agency and designated as 
such by Treasury in consultation with 
the Federal functional regulators. The 
procedures must require the broker- 
dealer to make such a determination 
within a reasonable period of time after 
the account is opened, or earlier if 
required by another Federal law or 
regulation or Federal directive issued in 
connection with the applicable list. The 
procedures also must require the broker- 
dealer to follow all Federal directives 
issued in connection with such lists. 
<Node id="420399"/>(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must 
include procedures for providing 
customers with adequate notice that the 
broker-dealer is requesting information 
to verify their identities.

<Node id="420845"/>(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is 
adequate if the broker-dealer generally 
describes the identification 
requirements of this section and 
provides such notice in a manner 
reasonably designed to ensure that a 
customer is able to view the notice, or 
is otherwise given notice, before 
opening an account. For example, 
depending upon the manner in which 
the account is opened, a broker-dealer 
may post a notice in the lobby or on its 
Web site, include the notice on its 
account applications or use any other 
form of oral or written notice. 
<Node id="421392"/>(iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a 
broker-dealer may use the following 
sample language to provide notice to its 
customers: 
Important Information About Procedures for 
Opening a New Account 
<Node id="421590"/>To help the government fight the funding 
of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that 
identifies each person who opens an account. 
<Node id="421822"/>What this means for you: When you open 
an account, we will ask for your name, 
address, date of birth and other information 
that will allow us to identify you. We may 
also ask to see your driver&#x2019;s license or other 
identifying documents. 
<Node id="422064"/>(6) Reliance on another financial 
institution. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when the broker- 
dealer will rely on the performance by 
another financial institution (including 
an affiliate) of any procedures of the 
broker-dealer&#x2019;s CIP, with respect to any 
customer of the broker-dealer that is 
opening an account or has established 
an account or similar business 
relationship with the other financial 
institution to provide or engage in 
services, dealings, or other financial 
transactions, provided that: 
<Node id="422593"/>(i) Such reliance is reasonable under 
the circumstances; 
<Node id="422652"/>(ii) The other financial institution is 
subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. 
5318(h), and regulated by a Federal 
functional regulator; and 
<Node id="422799"/>(iii) The other financial institution 
enters into a contract requiring it to 
certify annually to the broker-dealer that 
it has implemented its anti-money 
laundering program, and that it will 
perform (or its agent will perform) 
specified requirements of the broker- 
dealer&#x2019;s CIP. <Node id="423085"/>
<Node id="423086"/>(b) Exemptions. The Commission, 
with the concurrence of the Secretary, 
may by order or regulation exempt any 
broker-dealer that registers with the 
Commission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78o 
or 15 U.S.C. 78o&#x2013;4 or any type of 
account from the requirements of this 
section. The Secretary, with the 
concurrence of the Commission, may 
<Node id="423419"/>exempt any broker-dealer that registers 
with the Commission pursuant to 15 
U.S.C. 78o&#x2013;5. In issuing such 
exemptions, the Commission and the 
Secretary shall consider whether the 
exemption is consistent with the 
purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act, and 
in the public interest, and may consider 
other necessary and appropriate factors. <Node id="423757"/>
<Node id="423758"/>(c) Other requirements unaffected. 
Nothing in this section relieves a broker- 
dealer of its obligation to comply with 
any other provision of this chapter,

<Node id="425654"/>(a) General. (1) Every broker or dealer 
in securities within the United States 
(for purposes of this section, a &#x2018;&#x2018;broker- 
dealer&#x2019;&#x2019;) shall file with FinCEN, to the 
extent and in the manner required by 
this section, a report of any suspicious 
transaction relevant to a possible 
violation of law or regulation. A broker- 
dealer may also file with FinCEN a 
report of any suspicious transaction that 
it believes is relevant to the possible 
violation of any law or regulation but 
whose reporting is not required by this 
section. Filing a report of a suspicious 
transaction does not relieve a broker- 
dealer from the responsibility of 
complying with any other reporting 
requirements imposed by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission or a self- 
regulatory organization (&#x2018;&#x2018;SRO&#x2019;&#x2019;) (as 
defined in section 3(a)(26) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 
U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)). 
<Node id="426543"/>(2) A transaction requires reporting 
under the terms of this section if it is 
conducted or attempted by, at, or 
through a broker-dealer, it involves or 
aggregates funds or other assets of at 
least $5,000, and the broker-dealer 
knows, suspects, or has reason to 
suspect that the transaction (or a pattern 
of transactions of which the transaction 
is a part): 
<Node id="426910"/>(i) Involves funds derived from illegal 
activity or is intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activity (including, 
without limitation, the ownership, 
nature, source, location, or control of 
such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any Federal law or 
regulation or to avoid any transaction 
reporting requirement under Federal 
law or regulation; 
<Node id="427333"/>(ii) Is designed, whether through 
structuring or other means, to evade any

contains all relevant facts). 
<Node id="428516"/>(b) Filing procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. 
A suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report by the Securities and 
Futures Industry (&#x2018;&#x2018;SAR&#x2013;SF&#x2019;&#x2019;), and 
collecting and maintaining supporting 
documentation as required by paragraph 
(d) of this section. 
<Node id="428805"/>(2) Where to file. The SAR&#x2013;SF shall be 
filed with FinCEN in a central location, 
to be determined by FinCEN, as 
indicated in the instructions to the 
SAR&#x2013;SF. 
<Node id="428966"/>(3) When to file. A SAR&#x2013;SF shall be 
filed no later than 30 calendar days after 
the date of the initial detection by the 
reporting broker-dealer of facts that may 
constitute a basis for filing a SAR&#x2013;SF 
under this section. If no suspect is 
identified on the date of such initial 
detection, a broker-dealer may delay 
filing a SAR&#x2013;SF for an additional 30 
calendar days to identify a suspect, but 
in no case shall reporting be delayed 
more than 60 calendar days after the 
date of such initial detection. In 
situations involving violations that 
require immediate attention, such as 
terrorist financing or ongoing money 
laundering schemes, the broker-dealer 
shall immediately notify by telephone 
an appropriate law enforcement 
authority in addition to filing timely a 
SAR&#x2013;SF. Broker-dealers wishing 
voluntarily to report suspicious 
transactions that may relate to terrorist 
activity may call FinCEN&#x2019;s Financial 
Institutions Hotline at 1&#x2013;866&#x2013;556&#x2013;3974 
in addition to filing timely a SAR&#x2013;SF if 
required by this section. The broker- 
dealer may also, but is not required to, 
contact the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to report in such situations<Node id="430133"/>. 
<Node id="430136"/>(c) Exceptions. (1) A broker-dealer is 
not required to file a SAR&#x2013;SF to report: 
<Node id="430218"/>(i) A robbery or burglary committed or 
attempted of the broker-dealer that is 
reported to appropriate law enforcement 
authorities, or for lost, missing, 
counterfeit, or stolen securities with 
respect to which the broker-dealer files 
a report pursuant to the reporting 
requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f&#x2013;1; 
<Node id="430528"/>(ii) A violation otherwise required to 
be reported under this section of any of 
the Federal securities laws or rules of an 
SRO by the broker-dealer or any of its 
officers, directors, employees, or other 
registered representatives, other than a 
violation of 17 CFR 240.17a&#x2013;8 or 17 CFR 
405.4, so long as such violation is 
appropriately reported to the SEC or an 
SRO. 
<Node id="430903"/>(2) A broker-dealer may be required to 
demonstrate that it has relied on an 
exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, and must maintain records of 
<Node id="431059"/>its determinations to do so for the 
period specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section. To the extent that a Form RE&#x2013; 
3, Form U&#x2013;4, or Form U&#x2013;5 concerning 
the transaction is filed consistent with 
the SRO rules, a copy of that form will 
be a sufficient record for purposes of 
this paragraph (c)(2). 
<Node id="431363"/>(3) For the purposes of this paragraph 
(c) the term &#x2018;&#x2018;Federal securities laws&#x2019;&#x2019;

is defined in section 3(a)(47) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 
U.S.C. 78c(a)(47), and the rules and 
regulations promulgated by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
under such laws. <Node id="431689"/>
<Node id="431690"/>(d) Retention of records. A broker- 
dealer shall maintain a copy of any 
SAR&#x2013;SF filed and the original or 
business record equivalent of any 
supporting documentation for a period 
of five years from the date of filing the 
SAR&#x2013;SF. Supporting documentation 
shall be identified as such and 
maintained by the broker-dealer, and 
shall be deemed to have been filed with 
the SAR&#x2013;SF. A broker-dealer shall make 
all supporting documentation available 
to FinCEN, any other appropriate law 
enforcement agencies or Federal or State 
securities regulators, and for purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, to an SRO 
registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, upon request. <Node id="432378"/>
<Node id="432379"/>(e) Confidentiality of reports. No 
financial institution, and no director, 
officer, employee, or agent of any

programs for mutual funds. 
<Node id="446920"/>(a) Customer identification program: 
minimum requirements&#x2014;(1) In general. 
A mutual fund must implement a 
written Customer Identification Program 
(&#x2018;&#x2018;CIP&#x2019;&#x2019;) appropriate for its size and type 
of business that, at a minimum, includes 
each of the requirements of paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (5) of this section. The 
CIP must be a part of the mutual fund&#x2019;s 
anti-money laundering program 
required under the regulations 
implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h). 
<Node id="447374"/>(2) Identity verification procedures. 
The CIP must include risk-based 
procedures for verifying the identity of 
each customer to the extent reasonable 
and practicable. The procedures must 
enable the mutual fund to form a 
reasonable belief that it knows the true 
identity of each customer. The 
procedures must be based on the mutual 
<Node id="447714"/>fund&#x2019;s assessment of the relevant risks, 
including those presented by the 
manner in which accounts are opened, 
fund shares are distributed, and 
purchases, sales and exchanges are 
effected, the various types of accounts 
maintained by the mutual fund, the 
various types of identifying information 
available, and the mutual fund&#x2019;s 
customer base. At a minimum, these 
procedures must contain the elements 
described in this paragraph (a)(2). 
<Node id="448162"/>(i) Customer information required&#x2014;

mutual fund must obtain, at a 
minimum, the following information 
prior to opening an account:

(2) Date of birth, for an individual; 
(3) Address, which shall be: 
(i) For an individual, a residential or 
<Node id="448652"/>business street address; 
(ii) For an individual who does not 
<Node id="448715"/>have a residential or business street 
address, an Army Post Office (APO) or 
Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or 
the residential or business street address 
of next of kin or of another contact 
individual; or 
<Node id="448931"/>(iii) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), a principal place 
of business, local office or other 
physical location; and 
<Node id="449104"/>(4) Identification number, which shall 
be:

safeguard. 
<Node id="449545"/>Note to Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When 
opening an account for a foreign business or 
enterprise that does not have an 
identification number, the mutual fund must 
request alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the 
business or enterprise. 
<Node id="449826"/>(B) Exception for persons applying for 
a taxpayer identification number.

that the application was filed before the 
person opens the account and to obtain 
the taxpayer identification number 
within a reasonable period of time after 
the account is opened. 
<Node id="450658"/>(ii) Customer verification. The CIP 
must contain procedures for verifying 
the identity of the customer, using the 
information obtained in accordance

within a reasonable time after the 
account is opened. The procedures must 
describe when the mutual fund will use 
documents, non-documentary methods, 
or a combination of both methods as 
described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). 
<Node id="451085"/>(A) Verification through documents. 
For a mutual fund relying on 
documents, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the documents 
that the mutual fund will use. These 
documents may include: 
<Node id="451288"/>(1) For an individual, unexpired 
government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver&#x2019;s license or

individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), documents 
showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of 
incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership 
agreement, or trust instrument. 
<Node id="451761"/>(B) Verification through non- 
documentary methods. For a mutual 
fund relying on non-documentary 
methods, the CIP must contain 
procedures that describe the non- 
documentary methods the mutual fund 
will use. 
<Node id="451974"/>(1) These methods may include 
contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer&#x2019;s identity 
through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with 
information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or 
other source; checking references with 
other financial institutions; and 
obtaining a financial statement. 
<Node id="452334"/>(2) The mutual fund&#x2019;s non- 
documentary procedures must address 
situations where an individual is unable 
to present an unexpired government- 
issued identification document that 
bears a photograph or similar safeguard; 
the mutual fund is not familiar with the 
documents presented; the account is 
opened without obtaining documents; 
the customer opens the account without 
appearing in person; and where the 
mutual fund is otherwise presented 
with circumstances that increase the 
risk that the mutual fund will be unable 
<Node id="452865"/>to verify the true identity of a customer 
through documents. 
<Node id="452928"/>(C) Additional verification for certain 
customers. The CIP must address 
situations where, based on the mutual 
fund&#x2019;s risk assessment of a new account 
opened by a customer that is not an 
individual, the mutual fund will obtain 
information about individuals with 
authority or control over such account, 
including persons authorized to effect 
transactions in the shareholder of 
record&#x2019;s account, in order to verify the 
customer&#x2019;s identity. This verification 
method applies only when the mutual 
fund cannot verify the customer&#x2019;s true 
identity using the verification methods 
described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and 
(B) of this section. 
<Node id="453578"/>(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must 
include procedures for responding to 
circumstances in which the mutual fund 
cannot form a reasonable belief that it 
knows the true identity of a customer. 
These procedures should describe: 
<Node id="453814"/>(A) When the mutual fund should not 
open an account; 
<Node id="453869"/>(B) The terms under which a customer 
may use an account while the mutual 
fund attempts to verify the customer&#x2019;s 
identity; 
<Node id="453995"/>(C) When the mutual fund should file 
a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulation; and 
<Node id="454119"/>(D) When the mutual fund should 
close an account, after attempts to verify 
a customer&#x2019;s identity have failed. 
<Node id="454232"/>(3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must 
include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information 
obtained under paragraph (a) of this 
section. 
<Node id="454389"/>(i) Required records. At a minimum, 
the record must include: 
<Node id="454452"/>(A) All identifying information about 
a customer obtained under paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; 
<Node id="454556"/>(B) A description of any document 
that was relied on under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the 
type of document, any identification 
number contained in the document, the 
place of issuance, and if any, the date 
of issuance and expiration date; 
<Node id="454821"/>(C) A description of the methods and 
the results of any measures undertaken 
to verify the identity of the customer 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of 
this section; and 
<Node id="454999"/>(D) A description of the resolution of 
any substantive discrepancy discovered 
when verifying the identifying 
information obtained. 
<Node id="455134"/>(ii) Retention of records. The mutual 
fund must retain the information in 
paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for 
five years after the date the account is 
closed. The mutual fund must retain the 
<Node id="455337"/>information in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), 
(C), and (D) of this section for five years 
after the record is made. 
<Node id="455450"/>(4) Comparison with government lists. 
The CIP must include procedures for 
determining whether the customer 
appears on any list of known or 
suspected terrorists or terrorist 
organizations issued by any Federal 
government agency and designated as 
such by the Department of the Treasury 
in consultation with the Federal 
functional regulators. The procedures 
must require the mutual fund to make 
such a determination within a 
reasonable period of time after the 
account is opened, or earlier, if required 
by another Federal law or regulation or 
Federal directive issued in connection 
with the applicable list. The procedures 
must also require the mutual fund to 
follow all Federal directives issued in 
connection with such lists. 
<Node id="456196"/>(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must 
include procedures for providing 
mutual fund customers with adequate 
notice that the mutual fund is 
requesting information to verify their 
identities. 
<Node id="456390"/>(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is 
adequate if the mutual fund generally 
describes the identification 
requirements of this section and 
provides the notice in a manner 
reasonably designed to ensure that a 
customer is able to view the notice, or 
is otherwise given notice, before 
opening an account. For example, 
depending on the manner in which the 
account is opened, a mutual fund may 
post a notice on its Web site, include the 
notice on its account applications, or 
use any other form of written or oral 
notice. 
<Node id="456915"/>(iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a 
mutual fund may use the following 
sample language to provide notice to its 
customers: 
Important Information About Procedures for 
Opening a New Account 
<Node id="457111"/>To help the government fight the funding 
of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that 
identifies each person who opens an account. 
<Node id="457343"/>What this means for you: When you open 
an account, we will ask for your name, 
address, date of birth, and other information 
that will allow us to identify you. We may 
also ask to see your driver&#x2019;s license or other 
identifying documents. 
<Node id="457586"/>(6) Reliance on other financial 
institutions. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when a mutual 
fund will rely on the performance by 
another financial institution (including 
an affiliate) of any procedures of the 
mutual fund&#x2019;s CIP, with respect to any 
customer of the mutual fund that is

<Node id="458858"/>(b) Exemptions. The Commission, 
with the concurrence of the Secretary, 
may, by order or regulation, exempt any 
mutual fund or type of account from the

<Node id="460854"/> 1024.320 Reports by mutual funds of 
suspicious transactions. 
<Node id="460919"/>(a) General. (1) Every investment 
company (as defined in section 3 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 
U.S.C. 80a&#x2013;3) (&#x2018;&#x2018;Investment Company 
Act&#x2019;&#x2019;) that is an open-end company (as 
defined in section 5 of the Investment 
Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a&#x2013;5)) and 
that is registered, or is required to 
register, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission pursuant to that 
Act (for purposes of this section, a 
&#x2018;&#x2018;mutual fund&#x2019;&#x2019;), shall file with the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
to the extent and in the manner required 
by this section, a report of any 
suspicious transaction relevant to a 
possible violation of law or regulation. 
A mutual fund may also file with the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
a report of any suspicious transaction 
that it believes is relevant to the 
possible violation of any law or 
regulation, but whose reporting is not 
required by this section. Filing a report 
of a suspicious transaction does not 
relieve a mutual fund from the 
responsibility of complying with any 
other reporting requirements imposed 
by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
<Node id="462029"/>(2) A transaction requires reporting 
under this section if it is conducted or 
attempted by, at, or through a mutual 
fund, it involves or aggregates funds or 
other assets of at least $5,000, and the 
mutual fund knows, suspects, or has 
reason to suspect that the transaction (or 
a pattern of transactions of which the 
transaction is a part): 
<Node id="462378"/>(i) Involves funds derived from illegal 
activity or is intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activity (including, 
without limitation, the ownership, 
nature, source, location, or control of 
such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any Federal law or 
regulation or to avoid any transaction 
reporting requirement under Federal 
law or regulation; 
<Node id="462801"/>(ii) Is designed, whether through 
structuring or other means, to evade any 
requirements of this chapter or any 
other regulations promulgated under the 
Bank Secrecy Act; 
<Node id="462975"/>(iii) Has no business or apparent 
lawful purpose or is not the sort in 
which the particular customer would 
normally be expected to engage, and the 
mutual fund knows of no reasonable 
explanation for the transaction after 
examining the available facts, including 
the background and possible purpose of 
the transaction; or 
<Node id="463304"/>(iv) Involves use of the mutual fund 
to facilitate criminal activity. 
<Node id="463376"/>(3) More than one mutual fund may 
have an obligation to report the same 
transaction under this section, and other 
financial institutions may have separate 
obligations to report suspicious activity 
with respect to the same transaction 
pursuant to other provisions of this 
chapter. In those instances, no more 
than one report is required to be filed 
by the mutual fund(s) and other 
financial institution(s) involved in the 
transaction, provided that the report 
filed contains all relevant facts, 
including the name of each financial 
institution and the words &#x2018;&#x2018;joint filing&#x2019;&#x2019; 
in the narrative section, and each 
institution maintains a copy of the 
report filed, along with any supporting 
documentation. 
<Node id="464095"/>(b) Filing and notification 
procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. A 
suspicious transaction shall be reported 
by completing a Suspicious Activity 
Report by Securities and Futures 
Industries (&#x2018;&#x2018;SAR&#x2013;SF&#x2019;&#x2019;), and collecting 
and maintaining supporting 
documentation as required by paragraph 
(c) of this section. 
<Node id="464400"/>(2) Where to file. Form SAR&#x2013;SF shall 
be filed with the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network in accordance 
with the instructions to the Form 
SAR&#x2013;SF. 
<Node id="464553"/>(3) When to file. A Form SAR&#x2013;SF 
shall be filed no later than 30 calendar 
days after the date of the initial 
detection by the reporting mutual fund 
of facts that may constitute a basis for 
filing a Form SAR&#x2013;SF under this 
section. If no suspect is identified on the 
date of such initial detection, a mutual 
fund may delay filing a Form SAR&#x2013;SF 
for an additional 30 calendar days to 
identify a suspect, but in no case shall 
reporting be delayed more than 60 
calendar days after the date of such 
initial detection.

Enforcement Network&#x2019;s Financial 
Institutions Hotline at 1&#x2013;866&#x2013;556&#x2013;3974

mutual fund may also, but is not 
required to, contact the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to report in such 
situations. <Node id="466211"/>
<Node id="466212"/>(c) Retention of records. A mutual 
fund shall maintain a copy of any Form 
SAR&#x2013;SF filed by the fund or on its 
behalf (including joint reports), and the 
original (or business record equivalent) 
of any supporting documentation 
concerning any Form SAR&#x2013;SF that it 
files (or is filed on its behalf), for a 
period of five years from the date of 
filing the Form SAR&#x2013;SF. Supporting 
documentation shall be identified as 
such and maintained by the mutual 
fund, and shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the Form SAR&#x2013;SF. The 
mutual fund shall make all supporting 
documentation available to the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
any other appropriate law enforcement 
agencies or Federal or state securities 
regulators, and for purposes of an 
examination of a broker-dealer pursuant 
to  1023.320(g) of this chapter 
regarding a joint report, to a self- 
regulatory organization (as defined in 
section 3(a)(26) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(26)) registered with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, upon 
request. <Node id="467273"/>
<Node id="467274"/>(d) Confidentiality of reports. No 
mutual fund, and no director, officer, 
employee, or agent of any mutual fund, 
who reports a suspicious transaction 
under this chapter (whether such a 
report is required by this section or 
made voluntarily), may notify any 
person involved in the transaction that 
the transaction has been reported, 
except to the extent permitted by 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Any

SAR&#x2013;SF, including a Form SAR&#x2013;SF 
filed jointly with another financial 
institution involved in the same 
transaction (except where such 
disclosure is requested by the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
<Node id="468046"/>another appropriate law enforcement or 
regulatory agency, or, in the case of a

provide any information that would 
disclose that a Form SAR&#x2013;SF has been

notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network of any such request and its 
response thereto.<Node id="468647"/> 
<Node id="468649"/>(e) Limitation of liability. A mutual 
fund, and any director, officer, 
employee, or agent of such mutual fund, 
that makes a report of any possible 
violation of law or regulation pursuant 
to this section, including a joint report 
(whether such report is required by this 
section or made voluntarily) shall be 
protected from liability for any 
disclosure contained in, or for failure to 
disclose the fact of, such report, or both, 
to the extent provided in 31 U.S.C.

Compliance with this section shall be 
examined by the Department of the 
Treasury, through the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network or its delegees,

 1025.200 General. 
<Node id="475759"/>Insurance companies are subject to 
the program requirements set forth and 
cross referenced in this subpart. 
Insurance companies should also refer 
to Subpart B of Part 1010 of this Chapter 
for program requirements contained in 
that subpart which apply to insurance 
companies.

programs for insurance companies. 
<Node id="476111"/>(a) In general. Not later than May 2, 
2006, each insurance company shall 
develop and implement a written anti- 
money laundering program applicable 
to its covered products that is 
reasonably designed to prevent the 
insurance company from being used to 
facilitate money laundering or the 
financing of terrorist activities. The 
program must be approved by senior 
management. An insurance company 
shall make a copy of its anti-money 
laundering program available to the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
or their designee upon request. 
<Node id="476694"/>(b) Minimum requirements. At a 
minimum, the program required by 
paragraph (a) of this section shall: 
<Node id="476798"/>(1) Incorporate policies, procedures, 
and internal controls based upon the 
insurance company&#x2019;s assessment of the 
money laundering and terrorist 
financing risks associated with its 
covered products. Policies, procedures, 
and internal controls developed and 
implemented by an insurance company 
under this section shall include 
<Node id="477132"/>provisions for complying with the 
applicable requirements of subchapter II 
of chapter 53 of title 31, United States 
Code and this chapter, integrating the 
company&#x2019;s insurance agents and 
insurance brokers into its anti-money 
laundering program, and obtaining all 
relevant customer-related information 
necessary for an effective anti-money 
laundering program. 
<Node id="477500"/>(2) Designate a compliance officer 
who will be responsible for ensuring 
that: 
<Node id="477581"/>(i) The anti-money laundering 
program is implemented effectively, 
including monitoring compliance by the 
company&#x2019;s insurance agents and 
insurance brokers with their obligations 
under the program; 
<Node id="477783"/>(ii) The anti-money laundering 
program is updated as necessary; and

and trained in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
<Node id="477960"/>(3) Provide for on-going training of 
appropriate persons concerning their 
responsibilities under the program. An 
insurance company may satisfy this 
requirement with respect to its 
employees, insurance agents, and 
insurance brokers by directly training 
such persons or verifying that persons 
have received training by another 
insurance company or by a competent 
third party with respect to the covered 
products offered by the insurance 
company. 
<Node id="478417"/>(4) Provide for independent testing to 
monitor and maintain an adequate 
program, including testing to determine 
compliance of the company&#x2019;s insurance 
agents and insurance brokers with their 
obligations under the program. The 
scope and frequency of the testing shall 
be commensurate with the risks posed 
by the insurance company&#x2019;s covered 
products. Such testing may be 
conducted by a third party or by any 
officer or employee of the insurance 
company, other than the person 
designated in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.

requirements for insurance companies 
registered or required to register with the

dealer in securities shall be deemed to 
have satisfied the requirements of this

the extent that the company is required 
to establish and has established an anti- 
money laundering program pursuant to

 1025.320 Reports by insurance 
companies of suspicious transactions. 
<Node id="480669"/>(a) General. (1) Each insurance 
company shall file with the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network, to the 
extent and in the manner required by 
this section, a report of any suspicious 
transaction involving a covered product 
that is relevant to a possible violation of 
law or regulation. An insurance 
company may also file with the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
by using the form specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section or otherwise, a 
report of any suspicious transaction that 
it believes is relevant to the possible 
violation of any law or regulation but 
the reporting of which is not required by 
this section. 
<Node id="481310"/>(2) A transaction requires reporting 
under this section if it is conducted or 
attempted by, at, or through an 
insurance company, and involves or 
aggregates at least $5,000 in funds or 
other assets, and the insurance company 
knows, suspects, or has reason to 
suspect that the transaction (or a pattern 
of transactions of which the transaction 
is a part): 
<Node id="481674"/>(i) Involves funds derived from illegal 
activity or is intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activity (including, 
without limitation, the ownership, 
nature, source, location, or control of 
such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any Federal law or 
regulation or to avoid any transaction 
reporting requirement under Federal 
law or regulation; 
<Node id="482097"/>(ii) Is designed, whether through 
structuring or other means, to evade any 
requirements of this chapter or of any 
<Node id="482214"/>other regulations promulgated under the 
Bank Secrecy Act; 
<Node id="482274"/>(iii) Has no business or apparent 
lawful purpose or is not the sort in 
which the particular customer would 
normally be expected to engage, and the 
insurance company knows of no 
reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available 
facts, including the background and 
possible purpose of the transaction; or 
<Node id="482609"/>(iv) Involves use of the insurance 
company to facilitate criminal activity. 
<Node id="482687"/>(3)(i) An insurance company is 
responsible for reporting suspicious 
transactions conducted through its 
insurance agents and insurance brokers. 
Accordingly, an insurance company 
shall establish and implement policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
obtain customer-related information 
necessary to detect suspicious activity 
from all relevant sources, including 
from its insurance agents and insurance 
brokers, and shall report suspicious 
activity based on such information. 
<Node id="483180"/>(ii) Certain insurance agents may have 
a separate obligation to report 
suspicious activity pursuant to other 
provisions of this chapter. In those 
instances, no more than one report is 
required to be filed by the financial 
institutions involved in the transaction, 
as long as the report filed contains all 
relevant facts, including the names of 
both institutions and the words &#x2018;&#x2018;joint 
filing&#x2019;&#x2019; in the narrative section, and both 
institutions maintain a copy of the 
report filed, along with any supporting 
documentation. 
<Node id="483713"/>(iii) An insurance company that 
issues variable insurance products 
funded by separate accounts that meet 
the definition of a mutual fund in 
 1024.320(a)(1) of this Chapter shall file 
reports of suspicious transactions 
pursuant to  1024.320 of this Chapter. 
<Node id="483979"/>(b) Filing procedures&#x2014;(1) What to file. 
A suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report by Insurance Companies 
(SAR&#x2013;IC), and collecting and 
maintaining supporting documentation 
as required by paragraph (d) of this 
section. 
<Node id="484248"/>(2) Where to file. The SAR&#x2013;IC shall be 
filed with the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network as indicated in 
the instructions to the SAR&#x2013;IC. 
<Node id="484391"/>(3) When to file. A SAR&#x2013;IC shall be 
filed no later than 30 calendar days after 
the date of the initial detection by the 
insurance company of facts that may 
constitute a basis for filing a SAR&#x2013;IC 
under this section. If no suspect is 
identified on the date of such initial 
detection, an insurance company may 
delay filing a SAR&#x2013;IC for an additional 
30 calendar days to identify a suspect, 
<Node id="484788"/>but in no case shall reporting be delayed 
more than 60 calendar days after the 
date of such initial detection. In 
situations that require immediate 
attention, such as terrorist financing or 
ongoing money laundering schemes, the 
insurance company shall immediately 
notify by telephone an appropriate law 
enforcement authority in addition to 
filing timely a SAR&#x2013;IC. Insurance 
companies wishing voluntarily to report 
suspicious transactions that may relate 
to terrorist activity may call the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network&#x2019;s Financial Institutions Hotline 
at 1&#x2013;866&#x2013;556&#x2013;3974 in addition to filing 
timely a SAR&#x2013;IC if required by this 
section. 
<Node id="485450"/>(c) Exception. An insurance company 
is not required to file a SAR&#x2013;IC to report 
the submission to it of false or 
fraudulent information to obtain a 
policy or make a claim, unless the 
company has reason to believe that the 
false or fraudulent submission relates to 
money laundering or terrorist financing. 
<Node id="485762"/>(d) Retention of records. An insurance 
company shall maintain a copy of any 
SAR&#x2013;IC filed and the original or 
business record equivalent of any 
supporting documentation for a period 
of five years from the date of filing the 
SAR&#x2013;IC. Supporting documentation 
shall be identified as such and 
maintained by the insurance company 
and shall be deemed to have been filed 
with the SAR&#x2013;IC. When an insurance 
company has filed or is identified as a 
filer in a joint Suspicious Activity 
Report, the insurance company shall 
maintain a copy of such joint report 
(together with copies of any supporting 
documentation) for a period of five 
years from the date of filing. An 
insurance company shall make all 
supporting documentation available to 
the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network and any other appropriate law 
enforcement agencies or supervisory 
agencies upon request. 
<Node id="486645"/>(e) Confidentiality of reports; 
limitation of liability. No insurance 
company, and no director, officer, 
employee, agent, or broker of any 
insurance company, who reports a 
suspicious transaction under this 
chapter (whether such a report is 
required by this section or made 
voluntarily), may notify any person 
involved in the transaction that the 
transaction has been reported, except to 
the extent permitted by paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section. Thus, any insurance 
company subpoenaed or otherwise 
requested to disclose a SAR&#x2013;IC or the 
information contained in a SAR&#x2013;IC (or 
a copy of a joint Suspicious Activity 
Report filed with another financial

<Node id="498229"/> 1026.220 Customer identification 
programs for futures commission 
merchants and introducing brokers. 
<Node id="498334"/>(a) Customer identification program: 
Minimum requirements&#x2014;(1) In general. 
Each futures commission merchant and 
introducing broker must implement a 
written Customer Identification Program 
(CIP) appropriate for its size and 
business that, at a minimum, includes 
each of the requirements of paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. The 
CIP must be a part of each futures 
commission merchant&#x2019;s and introducing 
broker&#x2019;s anti-money laundering 
compliance program required under 31 
U.S.C. 5318(h). 
<Node id="498847"/>(2) Identity verification procedures. 
The CIP must include risk-based 
procedures for verifying the identity of 
each customer to the extent reasonable 
<Node id="499001"/>and practicable. The procedures must 
enable each futures commission 
merchant and introducing broker to 
form a reasonable belief that it knows 
the true identity of each customer. The 
procedures must be based on the futures 
commission merchant&#x2019;s or introducing 
broker&#x2019;s assessment of the relevant risks, 
including those presented by the 
various types of accounts maintained, 
the various methods of opening 
accounts, the various types of 
identifying information available, and 
the futures commission merchant&#x2019;s or 
introducing broker&#x2019;s size, location and 
customer base. At a minimum, these 
procedures must contain the elements 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. 
<Node id="499690"/>(i)(A) Customer information required. 
The CIP must include procedures for 
opening an account that specify 
identifying information that will be 
obtained from each customer. Except as 
permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of 
this section, each futures commission 
merchant and introducing broker must 
obtain, at a minimum, the following 
information prior to opening an 
account: 
<Node id="500074"/>(1) Name; 
(2) Date of birth, for an individual; 
(3) Address, which shall be: 
(i) For an individual, a residential or 
<Node id="500195"/>business street address; 
(ii) For an individual who does not 
<Node id="500258"/>have a residential or business street 
address, an Army Post Office (APO) or 
Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or 
the residential or business street address 
of a next of kin or another contact 
individual; or 
<Node id="500473"/>(iii) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), a principal place 
of business, local office or other 
physical location; and 
<Node id="500645"/>(4) Identification number, which shall 
be: 
<Node id="500690"/>(i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer 
identification number; or 
<Node id="500752"/>(ii) For a non-U.S. person, one or more 
of the following: A taxpayer

number and country of issuance, an 
alien identification card number, or the 
number and country of issuance of any 
other government-issued document 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard. 
<Node id="501095"/>Note to Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When 
opening an account for a foreign business or 
enterprise that does not have an

<Node id="501678"/>(B) Exception for persons applying for 
a taxpayer identification number. 
Instead of obtaining a taxpayer 
identification number from a customer 
prior to opening an account, the CIP 
may include procedures for opening an 
account for a customer that has applied 
for, but has not received, a taxpayer 
identification number. In this case, the 
CIP must include procedures to confirm 
that the application was filed before the 
customer opens the account and to 
obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of 
time after the account is opened. 
<Node id="502251"/>(ii) Customer verification. The CIP 
must contain procedures for verifying 
the identity of each customer, using 
information obtained in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, 
within a reasonable time before or after 
the customer&#x2019;s account is opened. The 
procedures must describe when the 
futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker will use documents, 
non-documentary methods, or a 
combination of both methods, as 
described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). 
<Node id="502737"/>(A) Verification through documents. 
For a futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker relying on 
documents, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the documents 
the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker will use. These 
documents may include: 
<Node id="503013"/>(1) For an individual, an unexpired 
government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver&#x2019;s license or 
passport; and 
<Node id="503215"/>(2) For a person other than an 
individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), documents 
showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of 
incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership 
agreement, or a trust instrument. 
<Node id="503490"/>(B) Verification through non- 
documentary methods. For a futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker relying on non-documentary 
methods, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the non- 
documentary methods the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker will use. 
<Node id="503782"/>(1) These methods may include 
contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer&#x2019;s identity 
through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with 
information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or 
other source; checking references with 
other financial institutions; or obtaining 
a financial statement. 
<Node id="504141"/>(2) The futures commission 
merchant&#x2019;s or introducing broker&#x2019;s non- 
documentary procedures must address 
situations where an individual is unable 
to present an unexpired government- 
issued identification document that 
bears a photograph or similar safeguard; 
the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker is not familiar with 
the documents presented; the account is 
opened without obtaining documents; 
the customer opens the account without 
appearing in person at the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker; and where the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker is otherwise presented with 
circumstances that increase the risk that 
the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker will be unable to 
verify the true identity of a customer 
through documents. 
<Node id="504952"/>(C) Additional verification for certain 
customers. The CIP must address 
situations where, based on the futures 
commission merchant&#x2019;s or introducing 
broker&#x2019;s risk assessment of a new 
account opened by a customer that is 
not an individual, the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker will obtain information about 
individuals with authority or control 
over such account in order to verify the 
customer&#x2019;s identity. This verification 
method applies only when the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker cannot verify the customer&#x2019;s true 
identity after using the verification 
methods described in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. 
<Node id="505632"/>(iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must 
include procedures for responding to 
circumstances in which the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker cannot form a reasonable belief 
that it knows the true identity of a 
customer. These procedures should 
describe: 
<Node id="505908"/>(A) When an account should not be 
opened; 
<Node id="505952"/>(B) The terms under which a customer 
may conduct transactions while the 
futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker attempts to verify the 
customer&#x2019;s identity; 
<Node id="506123"/>(C) When an account should be closed 
after attempts to verify a customer&#x2019;s 
identity have failed; and 
<Node id="506227"/>(D) When the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker should 
file a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulation. 
<Node id="506386"/>(3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must 
include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information 
obtained under procedures 
implementing paragraph (a) of this 
section. 
<Node id="506568"/>(i) Required records. At a minimum, 
the record must include: 
<Node id="506631"/>(A) All identifying information about 
a customer obtained under paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; 
<Node id="506735"/>(B) A description of any document 
that was relied on under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the 
type of document, any identification 
number contained in the document, the 
place of issuance, and if any, the date 
of issuance and expiration date; 
<Node id="507000"/>(C) A description of the methods and 
the results of any measures undertaken 
to verify the identity of a customer 
under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of 
this section; and 
<Node id="507178"/>(D) A description of the resolution of 
each substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the 
identifying information obtained. 
<Node id="507314"/>(ii) Retention of records. Each futures 
commission merchant and introducing 
broker must retain the records made 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section for five years after the account 
is closed and the records made under 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of 
this section for five years after the 
record is made. In all other respects, the 
records must be maintained pursuant to 
the provisions of 17 CFR 1.31. 
<Node id="507744"/>(4) Comparison with government lists. 
The CIP must include procedures for 
determining whether a customer 
appears on any list of known or 
suspected terrorists or terrorist 
organizations issued by any Federal 
government agency and designated as 
such by Treasury in consultation with 
the Federal functional regulators. The 
procedures must require the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker to make such a determination 
within a reasonable period of time after 
the account is opened, or earlier if 
required by another Federal law or 
regulation or Federal directive issued in 
connection with the applicable list. The 
procedures also must require the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker to follow all Federal directives 
issued in connection with such lists. 
<Node id="508542"/>(5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must 
include procedures for providing 
customers with adequate notice that the 
futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker is requesting 
information to verify their identities. 
<Node id="508762"/>(ii) Adequate notice. Notice is 
adequate if the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker 
generally describes the identification 
requirements of this section and 
provides such notice in a manner 
reasonably designed to ensure that a 
customer is able to view the notice, or 
is otherwise given notice, before 
opening an account. For example,

<Node id="509646"/>(iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a 
futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker may use the 
following sample language to provide 
notice to its customers: 
Important Information About Procedures for 
Opening a New Account 
<Node id="509881"/>To help the government fight the funding 
of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that 
identifies each person who opens an account. 
<Node id="510113"/>What this means for you: When you open 
an account, we will ask for your name, 
address, date of birth and other information 
that will allow us to identify you. We may 
also ask to see your driver&#x2019;s license or other 
identifying documents. 
<Node id="510355"/>(6) Reliance on another financial 
institution. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker will rely on the performance by 
another financial institution (including 
an affiliate) of any procedures of its CIP, 
with respect to any customer of the 
futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker that is opening an 
account, or has established an account 
or similar business relationship with the 
other financial institution to provide or 
engage in services, dealings, or other 
financial transactions, provided that: 
<Node id="510941"/>(i) Such reliance is reasonable under 
the circumstances; 
<Node id="511000"/>(ii) The other financial institution is 
subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. 
5318(h), and is regulated by a Federal 
functional regulator; and 
<Node id="511150"/>(iii) The other financial institution 
enters into a contract requiring it to 
certify annually to the futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker that it has implemented its anti- 
money laundering program, and that it 
will perform (or its agent will perform) 
specified requirements of the futures 
commission merchant&#x2019;s or introducing 
broker&#x2019;s CIP. 
<Node id="511513"/>(b) Exemptions. The CFTC, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary, may by 
order or regulation exempt any futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker that registers with the CFTC or 
any type of account from the 
requirements of this section. In issuing 
such exemptions, the CFTC and the 
Secretary shall consider whether the 
exemption is consistent with the 
purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act, and 
in the public interest, and may consider 
other necessary and appropriate factors. 
<Node id="512005"/>(c) Other requirements unaffected. 
Nothing in this section relieves a futures 
commission merchant or introducing 
broker of its obligation to comply with 
any other provision of this chapter, 
including provisions concerning 
information that must be obtained, 
verified, or maintained in connection 
with any account or transaction.

file with FinCEN a report of any 
suspicious transaction that it believes is 
relevant to the possible violation of any

properly and timely to report a 
suspicious transaction rests with each 
FCM and IB&#x2013;C involved in the 
transaction, provided that no more than 
one report is required to be filed by any

CFR chapter I), or the rules of any 
registered futures association or 
registered entity as those terms are 
defined in the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7 
U.S.C. 1a(29), by the FCM or IB&#x2013;C or 
any of its officers, directors, employees, 
or associated persons, other than a 
violation of 17 CFR 42.2, as long as such

8&#x2013;T, U&#x2013;5, or any other similar form 
concerning the transaction is filed 
consistent with CFTC, registered futures 
association, or registered entity rules, a

from the date of filing the SAR&#x2013;SF. 
Supporting documentation shall be 
identified as such and maintained by 
the FCM or IB&#x2013;C, and shall be deemed 
to have been filed with the SAR&#x2013;SF. An 
FCM or IB&#x2013;C shall make all supporting 
documentation available to FinCEN, the 
<Node id="519676"/>CFTC, or any other appropriate law 
enforcement agency or regulatory 
agency, and, for purposes of paragraph

suspicious transaction under this 
chapter, may notify any person involved 
in the transaction that the transaction 
has been reported, except to the extent 
permitted by paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. Thus, any person subpoenaed 
or otherwise requested to disclose a 
SAR&#x2013;SF or the information contained in 
a SAR&#x2013;SF, except where such 
disclosure is requested by FinCEN, the 
CFTC, another appropriate law 
enforcement or regulatory agency, or for 
purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, 
a registered futures association,

any such request and its response 
thereto. 
<Node id="520987"/>(f) Limitation of liability. An FCM or

C, that makes a report of any possible 
violation of law or regulation pursuant 
to this section or any other authority (or 
voluntarily) shall not be liable to any 
person under any law or regulation of 
the United States (or otherwise to the 
extent also provided in 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)(3), including in any arbitration 
or reparations proceeding) for any 
disclosure contained in, or for failure to 
disclose the fact of, such report. 
<Node id="521538"/>(g) Examination and enforcement. 
Compliance with this section shall be 
examined by the Department of the 
Treasury, through FinCEN or its
